Hi! Welcome to New Era Old World, a mod for Crusader Kings II
 -In this mod, there are a lot of new gameplay elements, cultures, realms, and many more changes and additions.
   This readme is a short document going over any features that do not or cannot have in-game descriptions due to limitations or being unreadable and clunky if put in-game

GAMEPLAY MECHANICS 

Combat and Warfare:

 - Ships have had their capacity increased to 1:150. or, now one ship can hold 150 troops
 - Seiges are now an active battle, instead of an army parking on a province and waiting for defenders to lose their morale, attacking troops will take losses as part of the siege- this is dependent on how many archers the defenders have.
    This also works in reverse- as an attacker, as you have more archers and handgonners, the seige will go even faster. With high skilled commanders and enough archers you can seige down a castle in weeks!
 -When you occupy a holding during war, you are now given the option to pillage it, destroying buildings in the holding for gold- when all buildings in a holding are pillaged the holding is destroyed comepletely.

Vassals, Councilors, Government Modifiers:

- New "Four Interests" Court Factions added from CK2+
   If a 4I (The four interests) faction is happy, it'll give you a bonus:
    - The Court Faction may give you +10% maximum and minimum feudal levies for five years.
    - The Prosperity Faction may give you +10% burgher taxes for five years.
    - The Glory Faction may give you a lump sum of prestige (scaling with the number and rank of members).
    - The Tradition Faction may give you a lump sum of piety (scaling with the number and rank of members).
    - Any of the factions may give you a lump sum of cash (scaling with the number and rank of members).

       If a 4I faction is angry, it'll make a demand on you--for lower obligations or crown authority, for your abdication, or merely for a county to be granted to one of its members. If you refuse its demands, it'll declare a civil war.

- Councilor traits now affect their success rates at tasks and missions
 - While there is some differences from role-to-role, it's fairly straightforward: having councilors with positive and virtuous traits will make them more effective, while negative and sinful traits will hinder their skills. A councilor who is Diligent will always do better than one who is Slothful
  A few more examples.
  - Spymasters will benefit from having traits like Deceitful, and suffer from being Honest or Trusting
  - Court Chaplains who are Zealous or Cruel are more effective at hunting heretics, but are LESS effective at converting provinces

- Corruption 
 - A new mechanic added for Imperial (including Nigerian and Bhutanese Imperial) and Eastern Bureaucratic governments, corruption is a realm modifier that is increased or decreased by various factors and events.
   Corruption is influenced by three main factors:
 1) Realm size
 2) Administrative skill of the realm (calculated by the Martial, Stewardship, and Intrigue skills of the ruler, their spouse, and relevant councilor)
 3) Ruler traits (however, this is much less significant than the other two factors)

 - Corruption is something that is mostly reduced or increased passively. Each year you will recieve a notification that "you are handed a report" when the modifier updates. This is represented as a character modifier which you can check at any time.
   - Occasionally you will get events which can modify corruption, e.g. accepting bribes for indulging a councilor's corrupt behavior. These events will also change said vassal's attitude towards you 

  - At zero-to-low levels of corruption, you'll have a slight bonus in tax and levy reinforcement rates, and a decrease in building time and costs. At high levels of corruption your realm will suffer in alomst all areas- taxes, levies, building cost and time, and will even affect courtier and vassal opinions.
     (However, one small positive effect of high corruption is greatly increased opinions from greedy, hedonistic, and otherwise corrupt characters)

Societies:

-There's two additional societies that are available for nearly every culture and religion now, The IMF and the Laureates
 - The IMF is a banking society, focusing on gaining bonuses to stewardship, realm prosperity, and ways to make more money as a member.
  - Occasionally members of the IMF will recieve a mission to "Wage a Debt War" against someone. Unlike a Warrior Society, there will NOT be a specific target given- instead ANY ruler that has defaulted on a loan or has bad credit will be a vlaid target for the Casus Belli.
    To help find a valid target, check the Diplomatic Relations view of the map to see all realms you can declare wars on.

 - The Laureates are a modificiation and expansion of the Hermetic Order, now members have many more potential areas of study, primarily focusing on pre-Event artifacts and knowledge.
   This includes searching for ancient texts, repairing artifacts, and the highest level members can lead expeditions to go North.
 

Miscellaneous changes:

 - Seasons now have a minor effect on levy reinforcement and tax rates, increasing in spring/summer and decreasing in autumn/winter
 - New terrain added: Tells
 - Terrain such as swamps, mountains, and hills make culture conversion rates slower
 - You can now ransom/take an artifact off of a prisoner in exchange for releasing them
 - Different terrain types now have buildings available that produce varying amounts of gold, like pastures, villages in hills and mountians, and others.
 - Roads are now able to be built in provinces in any sort of holding (limit 1 per county/province) that increase movement speed and provide other bonuses. This is VERY useful for provinces with difficult terrain such as deserts and mountains.


LORE, HISTORY, AND OTHER SUCH THINGS

Empires, old and new:

Bryttannya
 - The British Isles look (and speak) a little different now. The short version of why is that as Wales was less drastically effected by the Event than England, as as a result expanded influence across southern England.
   The Brittanic culture is a melting pot of English words using Welsh spelling and grammar. The Welsh influence fades the further north you go, until the Scottish border where there is Scots (Scottish/English) then you get the full Scottish Gaelic

 - It can be kind of a headache to read title names if you're unfamiliar with things, so here is a short pronounciation and spelling guide

	Standard English on left = Britannic Cultures on right
	#############
	All 3 Cultures get these unless overwritten by a specific other rule
	X = cks
	O = W
	f = F
	D = Dd
	y = i, e
	ph = ff
	V = Wy
	#############
	Scouse

	Y = Io at beginning of words
	l = ll unless there are already 2 ls in sequence
	th = f
	 
	############
	Southerner

	Hard C = K
	Soft C = s
	X = ks
	
	############
	Pryton
	r - rh
	o = o, it stays as is
	#############
	Clydbraek

	y = i anywhere
	a = ai
	th = t
	d = Dd or dd, only on the first d

Transnistria
 - Named for a region of Moldova meaning "beyond the Dniester River", the Empire of Transnistria extends from parts of Romania to across most of Ukraine.
	Transnistria as an empire faces some challenges as it's on the decline. A skilled ruler can stabilize the empire, a great one can make it the most powerful realm since The Event.
	However, there are others who would see the empire dissolved entirely: the Ukrainian people resent that their own empire, Greater Ruthenia, was destroyed and conquered by Transnistria- and if a powerful Ukrainian ruler takes the throne they will dissolve Transnistria to break free once more!
Jugoslavia
 - Restored post-Event, Jugoslavia has a syncretic faith combining the Christian and Muslim beliefs in the Balkans. This is a very teneous peace, and soon will begin to boil into a crisis that could shatter the entire realm! 
    Only a capable ruler will be able to maintain peace, and begin to spread the faith beyond vassals simply coverting out of politcal neccessity.
Bhutan
 - The single most technologically advanced realm in all the world, Bhutan (while not immune from the end of the world) has quietly endured the ages. Yet, it has become stagnant. 
   When starting a game in Bhutan you'll realize it is crippled by several ruler modifiers, each will only be able to be overcome through highly-skilled rulers and councilors in your court. While it will take some time and great effort, eventually Bhutanese Emperors will be able to fully reach their potential and expand beyond their mountain palaces.

DIASPORAS AND MELTING POTS:
 -Various cultures in NEOW, with details on who these peoples are (if needed) and also which cultures form melting pots in-game.

DEFINITIONS AND MISC. INFORMATION:

Tells - a new terrain type in NEOW, a tell is a kind of artificial hill or mound made from accumulated layers of sediment and debris formed
from succesive consecutive settlements at the same site over time. 
Or in simpler terms: take a building, knock most of it down, and then add dead leaves and other things decomposing into dirt until now there's a layer of soil and plants growing on top of it.
Mudbrick and stone buildings in ancient history, and now concrete and metal in the year 2555.

 -In-game, tells are mostly found in dense population centers such as London, Jerusalem, and Mumbai. 
  They're also a very valuable terrain to own, as holdings can build Artifact Mines which provide significant tax income, and a chance to find pre-event artifacts!
