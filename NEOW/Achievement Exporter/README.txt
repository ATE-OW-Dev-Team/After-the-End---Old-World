After The End Old World Achievement Exporter

This is a tool which exports achievements from savegames to savegames.

Usage:
	1. Copy the achievement_exporter.exe file to ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II
	2. Run the copied achievement_exporter.exe
	3. When the console closes, it should be done

Important note:
	Quick and Auto Save works, during named saving you should tick out "Compress game data"
	Do not play in Ironman mode
	It wouldn't work if you had changed the .mod file and the save game folder isn't "After-the-End---Old-World/save games"
	Having many saves may effect its performance badly, I would advice deleting older saves
