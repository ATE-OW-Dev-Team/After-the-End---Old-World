He took particular simpathy toward the Lithuanian leader, and this was crucial when, at the end of the war, the Orthodoxes of Belarus tried to gain independence from the Catholics of Lithuania. With Transnistria entangled in a civil war, the Pope had no problem backing the new King of Lithuania, even forcing the Holy League to stay in the country, officially to "ensure the Romuva scourge was completely removed". The massacres and forced conversions that followed were the bloodiest in the history of post-Event Europe, with entire towns slaughtered to the last man. More importantly, every Romuva ruler and priest was burned alive. The Romuva purge was succesful, and at the death of Pope Aemilius it had turned from a great threat to christianity to a dying faith.

He spent his reign trying to redirect the Holy League west to Numenor, but the growth of a new Prussian state near the border of Poland, the further breaking of Orthodox Transnistria and the formation of the Novelist nation of Occitania made every ruler less interested in risking so many men once more.
