All the while Bohdan Stovbur, now an Emperor of Grand Ruthenia decided to use the civil war in his favor and attacked. At first Ukrainers gained a lot, even taking the Bender Fortress and with it the ancient city of Chisinau. When civil war ended though, Majority of previously revolting Knights have sworn to Adriana to defend from Ruthenian menace in exchange for amnesty. Adriana, now assumed control over both armies, defeated Ukrainers in several small skirmishes and forcing them to retrieve to Odessa, were the Major battle ensued. Ruthenian army was eventually tricked into being trapped between to estuaries of Odessa and nearly whipped out, Emperor Bohdan killed by Adriana, who then proclaimed herself Empress of Transnistria and marched northward. Without an Emperor Grand Ruthenia started falling into discord, with Bohdans firstborn, Panas, swearing an oath to Adriana, and second son, Roman, escaping into Belarusian wilderness with remaining forces. The empress, finally achieving long awaited peace, has set to unite the empire by consolidating previously feral orthodox faith, recreating the seat of Ecumenical Patriarch and formalizing theology, a feat for which she was later canonized as a saint and is still venerated to this day.

He completely refused to consider a candidature of Floarea, the daughter of Mihai who escaped into Hungary when her father was executed, as an empress, considering her dead and instead proclaimed Himself to be a new Emperor, based on Corneliuses will(considered fake by most of the scholars).As such he married a daughter of the Korol of Ukraine, both to secure a Counter-Loyalist alliance and do give Lucian more legitimacy. In 2347, when nearly all(except for the ones on the eastern fringes) the loyalist armies were defeated, Lucian  arrived at Soroca castle and had started a siege. After a day the inside garrison had given up. It was later confirmed that one of the ballista projectiles somehow landed right in the balcony where the Emperor was walking.

Floarea later Betrothed to Konstantin, a cousin of Krisztian, King of Hungary at that point in exchange for military help in getting Transnistria back from Lucian and a Reactionary faction in control(who at the time dealt with increased cossack aggression and raids). When her husband, Kristian, became a King, they declared a war on Transnistria, ultimately beating Lucian, slaying him in the battle of Peresechen and reclaiming Transnistria. Floarea hadn't been so successful in her personal matters, she was infertile, and because of that her alliance with Hungary started to tremble down. She eventually managed to get pregnant, but, sadly for all the Transnistrians, died ad childbirth, living Transnistria with no Emperor and no visible heir to take the throne.

When he was done, and Emperor Marin passed away leaving an empire without Souvrain, he proclaimed his rights to the throne, attacking and defeating most of the transnistrian forces, making his way to Soroca. Upon reaching it he was met with semingly opened hands by delegation of aristocrats. In two weeks, when most cossack armies except the garrison were gone, they murdered the emperor while he was taking guests in his throne room. As the Aaroniad, an Epic Poem based on the events of the crisis of the XXIV century writes, the Leader of the Conspiracy, Hillel Gandzbitte, had taken the Pearl Crown from the dead man's head, and set on the throne, proclaiming himself an Emperor among his loyal guards and a stunned crowd who witnessed the process. The remaining cossack army, completely disoriented and squabbling among itself for leadership quickly dissolved into many disorganised rogue bands, pillaging the countryside.
