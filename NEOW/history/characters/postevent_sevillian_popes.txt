Surviving texts from the period testify of a man with an intelligent mind, an active body, and no fear of suffering for his religion. He was twice shot by arrows, three times stabbed by a sword and once beaten with sticks and clubs almost to death by a mob on his travels, but by the time of his death all of Andalusia, Extremadura and the southern regions of Castille and Catalonia were paying tribute to El Palmar rather than Rome. He is the most important post-Event Saint of the sevillian Church.

He did not want the title, believing other, younger candidates to be more capable, but after long discussions it was agreed that he was the better choice. He chose an humble name for himself, a lesser known Pope from long before the Event, and kept a low profile. This had the unexpected consequence of him giving his permission for the organization of the corsair ports, with both Andalusia and Castille recruiting some pirates to work under their control, something previous Popes had opposed. The corsair tradition endured in the 26th century and many call Spanish Corsairs the "Pirates of Eutychianus" to this day. His rule saw the first expansions of Catalonia and Andalusia at the expenses of the Castillan crown.

He died with only minor successes under his belt, like organizing the expulsion the last Catholic lords from Spain (an Aragonese and a Galician) and changing them for sevillian rulers.

The castilian King Felipe and many Aragonese ruler followed his call, to the point that the Catalan King was forced to allow them to cross in his land. The Second war against Andorra was a disaster. An epidemic hit Aragon decimating and demoralizing them, all while the Andorrans spent their days apparently partying beyond their stone wall. While this was likely a ruse, it still convinced many of the futility of this effort, and the army was receiving more and more defections daily. The last nail in the coffin for this second invasion was the Extremaduran-Galician rebellion, that forced Castille to recall the surviving army. Pope Petrus XV was forced to sign a peace treaty and fell from grace. A year later, when the Galicians gained independence, he refused to crown their first king, but the Bishop of Santiago did in his place, angering him. He died less than a year later at the age of 93.
