His reign started with the defeat of the Holy League, in which much of the Beneluxian army sent to Spain was lost either in the Battles on the Pyrenees or the following retreat through hostile Numenorean territory. This crippled horribly Benelux for decades to come, and wisely the Emperor played mostly defense in the following decades, pushing Numenor's prodding attacks back by personally leading the army up and down the western Borders. Having to ensure the loyalty of the Papacy in the face of the Numenorean strength, when Pope Pius XIII died, he sent orders to the Beneluxian faction at the Conclave that the next Pope had to be from Benelux. This led to the infamous Battle of the Conclave, in which the Polish and Beneluxian faction attacked each other openly. The victory of the Polish faction led to the election of a Polish Pope in 2249, that then excommunicated the lords of Benelux. To earn forgiveness, Emperor Hartman launched an Holy War against Numenor and the Novelist faith in 2250. According to the stories, a year later, on the day of Christmas, the decisive battle of the war took place. Emperor Hartman and Emperor Isildur of Numenor were drawn towards each other by the tides of battle, and a duel ensued. Both renowned fighters, the two exchanged blow after blow for ours, soon inflicting deep wounds on each other. The stories vary on how Emperor Hartman died, if killed by Isildur directly or killed by his wounds after retreating, but he didn't survive the day and passed away, defeated and still excommunicated.

However, the convenient death of the Pope allowed the Cardinals siding with him to push the Conclave forward before Polish representatives could arrive, ensuring the election of a Pope from Belgium. This ensured the lift of his excommunication and his formal crowning with papal blessing. In 2264, as a new Pope from the Polish faction was elected, he in response raised an Antipope, loyal to the Empire, using as an excuse supposed threats raised against the Cardinals from Benelux. In 2266, after the death of the Pope, he agreed to depose his own Antipope in exchange for a 'fair election', leading to the election of a dutch preacher. In 2280, surprisingly, a Pope from the Polish faction, granted the Emperor the permission to expand south, ordering all Catholic rulers from 'Luxembourg to the Swiss borders' to submit to Imperial authority. Most of them agreed - mostly because being under Imperial authority meant being protected by the growing Numenorean threat in the west - and the few that didn't were easily deposed by the Imperial army, leading to the birth of the Duchy of New Luxembourg.
