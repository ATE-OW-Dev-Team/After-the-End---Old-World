He reinforced the Shogun's control on the remaining Kashin and on the Chrysantemum Throne, and started to push north, aiming at taking control of the Hakodate Republic. However, here he was faced with the powerful opposition of the Grand City of Vladivostok. The Ezo War, as the conflict was called, ended with the defeat of the Shogunate, Vladivostok taking control of several of Hokkaido's main cities, and the forced betrothal of the Emperor's grandson and heir with a princess from Vladivostok. While the Shogun managed to then defeat several rebellions, he never again got even close to achieving his goal of rebuilding the Sato Shogunate.
