However, Sanphet went into seclusion and sent his adopted son to inform The Senate that he isnt avaliable. In the ensuring conflict, Sanphet's son waged war againsts entirety of Bangkok, damaging the barricade and dyke his father has built in hope of forcing the senate to surrender. Legend said that Bangkok river ran red for a decades afterward, many senators were slaughtered and their bodies were paraded on the flagship. Sanphet, realized what his adopted son has done and appaled by such excess cruelty disowned him on the spot. Despite that, his adoptee still serve him as Field Marshal for many years. After the conflict ended, Sanphet was the sole figure who could hold the fragmented Chao Phraya states together, and so he crowned himself as King Sanphet of Nakorn Pathom(posthumously conorated as Emperor of Siam)

And such he tried to slander his own son many times, with all attempts ending in failure as even his own younger sons has no interest in schemeing. In his last year, the voice in his head invited him to have a tea. And so he did.
