Save conversion allows replacing specified objects that no longer exist (E.G., due to being merged with something else, or being renamed).

Currently supported are religions and societies.
The game will simply try to replace one tag with another if it can't find the original tag.
E.G.,
religion = {
	bektashi = hurufi
}

Will result in all provinces and characters saved as Bektashi religion to become Hurufi if the Bektashi religion has been removed from the script DB
