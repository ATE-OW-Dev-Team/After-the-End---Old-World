novelist_DESC;Novelists were gatherers of knowledge of old. Ancient and mystics tomes holding depiction and exploits of past gods and heroes were reunited into one holy book, the Novel, telling the story of what really happened before the Fall. Some call it 'fiction', but Novelists firmly believe that they are precise and accurate transcriptions of the past, narrating stories of heroes worthy of worship, upon which one should seek the same fate.;Title;Title;;Title;;;;;;;;;x

#NOVELIST TITLE FORMATIONS
novelist50Title;The Return of the King;;;;;;;;;x
novelist50Desc;For centuries, the High Kingdom of Númenor ruled over much of Western Europe, from the Pyrenees in the south to Enedwaith in the east. But the cruelty of the British and the decadence of its last rulers caused Numenor to crumble, it has since become little more than a beautiful memory, something lost to dreams. Yet it was not to be, for [e_france.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick] has conquered, and [e_france.Holder.GetSheHe] has re-established that which was thought lost to the ages. Truly, [e_france.Holder.GetSheHe] will be remembered forever as the one who brought hope back to the scattered people of Aslan.;;;;;;;;;x

#NOVELIST FLAVOR EVENTS
novelist1001Title;A Quiet Front;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1001Desc;[From.GetBestName] died in battle, and a few words from the Novel come to mind...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1001;All was quiet on the western front, uh?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1001;One death is a tragedy, two thousands a statistic.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist1001;It is just as much a matter of chance that I am still alive as that I might have been hit.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist1001;Death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it.;;;;;;;;;x

novelist1010Title;Sleeping Beauty;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1010Desc;In the past days, you wandered the lands of [sleeping_beauty_province.GetName]. You did your duty as a [Root.GetLordLady], such as visiting your loyal subjects. Today you have been traveling from one settlement to another, when you noticed a strange castle, which isn't on your map. It seems to be abandoned for a long time, it is more like mere ruins now. You decide to explore it. After a short search you find a room where a beautiful girl is sleeping. You try to wake her up, but she stubbornly continues her slumber.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1010;A kiss could wake her up...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1010;Such a beautiful face... I shall keep it!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist1010;She won't notice if I take this now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist1010;I'd rather leave this strange place.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1010_tooltip;You can only hope it will end up well.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1011Desc;The kiss truly helps. The girl wakes up quickly. She is a little surprised at first and she almost passes out. When she calms down, she explains that she is the princess of [princess_title.GetName], or she just was. According to her the White Witch cursed her about one hundred years ago. She could only be woken up by a kiss, like yours. She seems really thankful for your help...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1011;How could I resist her?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1011;It was my duty.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist1011;I like to get my reward in gold.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1012Desc;After the kiss everything turns dark... You wake up at night, outside on the ground. You are at the place where the castle has been just a moment ago. A cold wind hits you and you hear a strange laughter...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1012;The White Witch, it was her!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1012;I surely just dreamed all of this.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1013Desc;The kiss truly helps. The girl wakes up quickly. She explains that she is just a peasant girl who was traveling from one village to another, just like you. She found the castle and thought it would be a nice place to stay for the night. However, she was tired and she is a heavy sleeper too, that's why she was sleeping so deeply when you found her. You speak with her for a while and she begin to make some rather kinky hints...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1013;What if we stayed for another night?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1013;Sorry, but I have to leave.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1014Desc;Today a peasant girl requested a visit to you. She was the one who you met at the ruined castle about two years ago. It seems that your night was rather fruitful...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1014;I guess [new_kid.GetFirstName] will be happier with me.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCnovelist.1116;A man has come to your court, presenting a piece of paper he claims to come from an ancient library. He asks for money to undertake the mission of exploring and cataloging the library's content and offers to sell to you the best volume in the ancient collection for a good sum.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAnovelist.1116;A donation shall be made.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBnovelist.1116;A goal worthy of my patronage.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCnovelist.1116;Everything must be done for the Novel!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDnovelist.1116;No, this sounds too good to be true.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCnovelist.1117;The research in the Ancient library bore fruits: the tome was uncovered and is now part of your collection.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAnovelist.1117;Praise L'Auteur!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCnovelist.1118;The man you sent to search tomes in the ancient library has never returned to your castle. After so long, you are forced to assume the worst: he tricked you and has escaped with your money.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAnovelist.1118;A lesson to be learned.;;;;;;;;;x

novelist1100Title;Beauty and the Beast;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1100Desc;For a long time, there have been rumors of a mysterious Beast in an abandoned castle hidden somewhere in the woods of my demesne. No one truly paid attention to it, until a farmer begun to tell tales of the Beast taking away his daughter. The man was desperate enough to bring his request for help to court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1100;Just the job for me!;;;;;;;;;#Only hunter
EVTOPTB_novelist1100;I could try to find it...;;;;;;;;;#Not hunter, almost always fail
EVTOPTC_novelist1100;I'm happy without searching for legendary beasts.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist1100;Stupid peasants and their stupid problems!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1100_tooltip;You will begin to search for the castle of the Beast.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1101Desc;As you travel through the woods, you run into a mysterious old lady, a florist judging from her basket of roses. She offers to tell you the way for the castle, if only you could spare a few coins for a poor elder...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1101;Take my gold and lead me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1101;Oh, I'm sure you will tell me...;;;;;;;;;#Cruel only
EVTOPTC_novelist1101;Telling me the way would save a girl.;;;;;;;;;#High diplomacy only
EVTOPTD_novelist1101;I can't afford something like this right now.;;;;;;;;;x
beauty_and_the_beast_lead;The old lady will lead you to the castle.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1105Desc;After days searching in the woods, you could find no tracks of any unusual creature, and you are starting to doubt this search...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1105;I will find it, because I want to find it.;;;;;;;;;#Stubborn only
EVTOPTB_novelist1105;Putting in a little more effort can't hurt.;;;;;;;;;#Diligent only
EVTOPTC_novelist1105;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], show me the way!;;;;;;;;;#Zealous only
EVTOPTD_novelist1105;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x
beauty_and_the_beast_continue_searching;You will continue to search.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1106Desc;You have spent more and more days travelling through the woods, and while you have found many good preys, none have resembled in any way a beast of legend. Your advisors insist it is time to give up on the search, and you find yourself agreeing.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1106;All these effort for nothing.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1110Desc;Thanks to your efforts, you manage to follow the trail of the Beast to a great ruin of what must have been a mighty fortress, although now it is but a ghost of it's former self. In amazement you stare for a moment at this remnant of the Old World, asking yourself what magic did [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] teach to the ancient to build it. Then, a mighty roar resounds from inside the building, and you suddenly remember what brings you here. Your challenge awaits, probably just beyond the entrance.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1110;And finally, we will meet.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1110;There must be another door to this building...;;;;;;;;;#High intrigue only
EVTOPTC_novelist1110;This is my last chance to leave...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1110_tooltip;You will enter the castle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1110_tooltip;You will sneak into the castle.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1111Desc;Sneaking around, you find a smaller entrance, one that is not blocked by planks of wood. The door creaks open, and your step touch a floor made of flat, polished stone, even if covered in perhaps centuries of dirt. As you tighten the grip on your sword, you sneak through the ancient castle, up some stairs to the higher floor to try and pass unnoticed, until you spot what must be the nest of the Beast. Here, the hideous creature sits in dim light, a great being unlike any you have seen before, terrifying yet intelligent judging by the light in its eyes. It seems busy with something else, not noticing you, and you find the perfect chance to attack it...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1111;He doesn't expect me now...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1111;This creature is harmless, I shall spare it.;;;;;;;;;x
beauty_and_the_beast_continue_attack;You will attack the Beast.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1112Desc;You enter the door, walking through a large corridor surrounded by many of what appear to be ancient rooms filled with broken relics and long destroyed items of the time before the Event. You follow a fresh trail on the ground and up a few stairs, your steps echoing on the dirty pavement, before the great Beast stands before you, its eyes smart and calm, contrasting with its great and fearsome body. Instinctively, you swing your sword, and the Beast roars as a wound appears on it's flesh. 'You don't understand, I need her...' it mutters.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1112;What's the matter, Beast, too kind and gentle to fight back?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist1112;Please listen, keeping that girl here isn't right.;;;;;;;;;#High learning only
EVTOPTC_novelist1112;Such an intelligent and nice creature, I shall leave him alone.;;;;;;;;;#Kind only
EVTOPTB_novelist1112_tooltip;You will try to convince the Beast.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1112Desc;You and the Beast had a long debate. In the end, the Beast agreed to let Belle go, leading you to her. The young girl is clearly scared, but does not appear overly terrified of the creature. You two leave together for the girl's farm, and as you wave at the Beast in the light of day, you can't help but notice how it looks more like a masked man in it's face and mannerism, rather than the fearsome creature you saw before. You shrug off the thought, riding back to more civilized parts of your lands.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1113;Nobody debates like [Root.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1114Desc;The Beast fights ferociously, claws cutting through your skin and horns piercing your belly, while your sword finds purchase more than once, leaving deep cuts in the creature's fur. Step after step, you two find yourself fighting near an open window. The Beast bellows in rage and attacks you. You have but a moment to scream, before your lifeless body hits the ground below, broken and bloody. With your last strength, you look up at the Beast and the young Belle, embracing it. The creature, you realize with your last thought, looks far more human, in the Sun...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1114;...and they live happily ever after?;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1115Desc_A;The Beast fights fiercely, using horns and claws to defend itself, but he is no match for your skills with the sword. After an heated confrontation, your sword strikes it's neck, and the head of the creature flies off, landing on the ground. Victorious, you pick it up, and in that moment notice young Belle, the lady that had disappeared so long ago. She runs to you crying, clearly tears of joy, and you two leave the ancient castle with a bloody trophy and a new tale to tell.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist1115Desc_B;Your sword strikes through, piercing the Beast's back. The creature roars in anger, swinging claws and horns in hopes to defend itself, but the wound is too severe and soon your sword strikes true, severing the head of the creature and ending the battle once and for all. Victorious, you pick up your bloody trophy, putting it in a bag, and in that moment notice young Belle, the beautiful lady you were searching for. She runs to you, crying what seem to be tears of joy, and you two leave the castle. You now have a new story to tell, that far surpasses that of any other hunter.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1115_A;Nobody fights like [Root.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist1115_B;Nobody sneaks like [Root.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x
beast_slayer_bloodline;Blood of the Beast Slayer;;;;;;;;;x
beast_slayer_bloodline_desc;Killing the Beast and saving Belle made [This.GetTitledFirstName] one of the most respected warriors of [This.GetHerHis] age.;;;;;;;;;x
head_of_the_beast;Head of the Beast;;;;;;;;;x
head_of_the_beast;This is the head of the Beast, slain by [OriginalOwner.GetBestName]. It looks very human-like, but the horns and fur clearly show it was a creature of Richelieu, not one of Eru.;;;;;;;;;x
