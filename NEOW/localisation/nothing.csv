druze_DESC;The Druze is an esoteric religion originating in Western Asia who self-identify as Al-Muwahhidun, meaning the people of Monotheism. At odds with their Abrahamic brothers, Jethro of Midian is considered their spiritual founder and chief prophet. The religion is based on the teachings of Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and the sixth Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Heavy Influence comes from Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Pythagoras. Christian figures like John the Baptist and Jesus Christ also play a large role as well defining the faith. The Druze religion believes after the end of the world they must go to China, unite and conquer the world from that point.;;;;;;;;;x

yazidi_DESC;Yazidi is a monotheistic religion that has roots in a western Iranic pre-Zoroastrian religion directly derived from the Indo-Iranian tradition. It is followed by the mainly Kurmanji-speaking Yazidis and is based on belief in one God who created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels. Preeminent among these Angels is Tawuse Melek, who is the leader of the Angels and who has authority over the world. In the Yazidi myth of creation, Tawuse Melek refused to bow before Adam, the first human, when God ordered the Seven Angels to do so. The command was actually a test, meant to determine which of these angels was most loyal to God by not prostrating themselves to someone other than their creator. This belief has been linked by some people to the Islamic mythological narrative on Iblis, who also refused to prostrate to Adam, despite God's express command to do so. Because of this similarity to the Islamic tradition of Iblis, Muslims and followers of Abrahamic religions have erroneously associated and identified the Peacock Angel with their own conception of the unredeemed evil spirit Satan and or Shaytan, a misconception which has incited centuries of violent religious persecution of the Yazidis as "devil-worshippers";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
