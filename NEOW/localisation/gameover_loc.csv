DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Wangchuck, the Dragon Emperors. Their rule has lasted in an unbroken line since hundreds of years before The Deluge. Even if their isolationist policy and stagnant way of doing things have made them averse to change, keeping them from making progress, they are still without a doubt the rulers of the most advanced civilization of the Old World, which was kept this way for centuries partially thanks to their wise rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Karadziordziewic, the Yugoslavic Emperors. When faced with the threat of the Greek Empire steadily conquering the Balkans, a group of small Kingdoms have formed a haphazard military confederation in an attempt to halt it, electing house Karadziordziewic to lead it. To everyone's surprise, their success was overwhelming and soon enough they have retaken all of the Balkans from the Greeks and turned Greece into their tributaries, and turned a haphazard military union into an Empire holding most of the Balkan peninsula. In an attempt to keep their vassals from fighting between each other they have attempted to introduce a new religion into the Balkans, Yugoslavism, which would incorporate all existing ones.

DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Belgium-Oranje-Nassau-Weilburg, who claim to be descendants of not one, but three different pre-event dynasties. Fitting, for the founders of Benelux, consisting of three Kingdoms. Catholic Benelux was without a doubt the first true Empire in Post-Event Europe, but soon it has fallen to Numenorian conquests. Despite this, house of Belgium-Oranje-Nassau-Weilburg kept the Imperial seat by converting and becoming vassals of the High King. They have kept this position throughout all of Numenor's history, until it's recent collapse. After the collapse, independent Benelux would emerge as a power again, but it was soon shattered in a succession crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN9_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Stovbur, Kings of Ruthenia. Founder of the dynasty, Borys the First, was originally a warchief ruling in the city of Poltava, just one of many in completely disorganized region of eastern Europe. He though, unlike the others, accumulated enough power to steamroll through his neighbours, unifying what once was known as Ukraine under his firm rule. In two generations his descendants, by conquering Belarus and Chernihov, had created Ruthenian Tsisarate, largest Eastern European state since the Event. However their advances were halted when Adriana, First Transnistrian Empress, defeated and slayed Tsisar Bohdan in the battle of Adessa. After that Ruthenia had split between Bohdans two sons, Panas becoming Korol of Ukraine under now dominant Nistrenian Empire and Roman escaping into Belarus, halting Transnistria's advances to the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN15_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Arindi, A dynasty originating from the city of Mumbai, the Lashkandradi claimed descent from the great Ioannes Karasci, the liberator of the Yunani and the first king of Yunakshetra. The dynasty rose to prominence when an adventurer known as Sikandar raised an army and managed to defeat and kill the Vahana ruler of Rajasthan. Soon, Laskandar subjugated the realms of Gujarat and the Indus river by force, and obtained overlordship over Ajmer by supporting a rival claimant to the throne. While Laskandar's achievements were impressive, they were ultimately undone when he died at a young age, leaving a mere child as his heir. Former generals, local governors, and subordinate kings refused to acknowledge the child-heir, while each attempted to claim Laskandar's empire for his own. House Mumbaikar was eventually reduced to merely ruling a few square miles of territory by 2555.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
