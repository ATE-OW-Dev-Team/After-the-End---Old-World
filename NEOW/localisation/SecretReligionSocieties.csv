secret_religious_society_west_african_pagan_desc_REAL;As preachers proselytize, there are those who play their part, but in secret turn to the forces around them.

Se cuentan historias entre ellos, sobre cómo la fe no reside en un reino sobrenatural, sino en los árboles que se alzan a su alrededor, en las rocas que pisan y en las aguas que beben.;;;;;;;;;x
