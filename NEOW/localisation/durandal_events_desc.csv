## The Blade
novelist2010Title;The Broken Sword;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2010Desc;A fisherman from a nearby village has approached you. He claims that he found an item he believes to hold great value for all Novelists, and is willing to offer it to you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2010;I have no time for such telltales, send him away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2010;Intriguing, let him in...;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2011Desc;The Fisherman comes into your court, presenting his finding in front of your throne. 'My lord, I bring you a treasure unlike any others'. He says, unraveling the bundle he carries in his arms. From it emerges the skeleton of a great wolf, in which is embedded the shining blade of a sword. 'I found this in my nets. I believe this is the body of the Beast of Gevedaun, and in it rests the blade of Durandal. I offer this precious treasure to you for a small price.' As one, the court turns to you, awaiting for your decision.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2011;I will pay the price you request!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2011;This is clearly a fabrication. Throw him out!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2011;I have a better idea. Guards, seize the blade!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist2011;What a glorious day! You deserve much more!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2012Desc;Visiting your treasury, you find yourself enchanted by the peerless beauty of the Blade of Durandal. Of all the weapons you have seen, none share quite the same allure. Truly, it was a weapon forged for a God and for the Hero of mankind. And now, you find yourself pondering if perhaps it is possible to reforge it once more...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2012;I shall research this!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2012;No, it's a foolish effort.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2013Desc;After a long research, your Council has managed to piece together the history of Durendal. They believe that, now that you have the blade, only three more pieces are lost: the pommel, the hilt, and the sheath. It is now up to you to choose which you will pursue.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2013;The Emperor gifted the Sheath to the sailor that led him to his final exile.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2013;The Pommel was stolen by a skilled thief and sold to the White Emperors.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2013;The Hilt was hidden by his family among the skeletons of the Faithful.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist2013;All have been found long ago.;;;;;;;;;x
## The Hilt - Route 1
novelist2110Title;The Hilt of Durendal;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2110Desc;The Skeletons of the Faithful must refer to a resting place of great relevance to the Novelist faith and to Aragorn Napoleon. You start to consider your choices.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2110;Perhaps it refers to the battlefields of Waterloo...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2110;The catacombs of Notre Dame are known for their many secrets.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2110;Only the most loyal followed Aragorn Napoleon in his prisony on Elba.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2111Desc;After a long search, it appears there is no trace of what you are hunting for.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2111;What a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2111;I need to reconsider my options.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2112Desc;Paris, a city dear to the great Aragorn Napoleon and the focus of many tales of the great Novel. As you travel those city in the steps of such heroes as Valjean and Gandalf, you find yourself feeling lighter, and realize in horror a pickpocket has stolen from you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2112;Quickly, we need to capture him!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2112;Call the Guards!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2112;He knows the streets too well. Let us continue our search.;;;;;;;;;x
#Captured thief
novelist21121Desc;The man is brought before you in tears, begging for forgiveness. However, shocking all present, he claims to be the guardian of the Hilt of Durendal, and to have robbed you only to test you. Ripitchip, this is his name, offers himself to you as a guide through the catacombs of Notre Dame in exchange of his life.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist21121;Very well, lead us.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist21121;There will be no deal between a lord and a thief.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist21121;Tell me the way and you will be free.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211214Desc;The thief falls to his knees, in awe at your mercy, and quickly explains to you that, once in the catacombs, you have to proceed left, right and left, and to look in the skull of iron.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211214;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211214Desc;The thief falls to his knees, in awe at your mercy, and quickly explains to you that, once in the catacombs, you have to proceed left, right and left, and to look in the skull of iron.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211214;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211215Desc;The ancient catacombs of Notre Dame. For centuries the people of Paris have used and enlarged them to give a resting place to the bones of their dead. As you make your way through this labyrinth of stone and bone, you find yourself facing three tunnels.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211215;We go left.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211215;Forward it is.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist211215;The right route seems correct.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211218Desc;The tunnel leads you to a strange room filled with various trinkets, probably from before the Event. There is no sign of the hilt and most items appear broken or ruined by time, but a particular painting attracts your attention.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211217;We shall take it, but let's continue our search.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211217Desc;As you proceed through the tunnel, you suddenly feel the terrain shake under you. A pit opens under your very feet.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211217;No...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211217;Your training allows you to react in time and grasp the edge.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211216Desc;You continue for a time that seems infinite, with your companions behind you and the skulls silently judging you. Finally, you reach a split, one tunnel leading to the left, one leading to the right.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211216;We continue left!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211216;Right this time!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211219Desc;Continuing on your path, you suddenly feel the floor shift slightly and a rumble. You look ahead and scream seeing a large boulder roll towards you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211219;No...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211219;Jump to the right, into the bones!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211220Desc;As you proceed further, hearing nothing but the breath of your companions, the crackling of the torches' fire, and the quick steps of mice hidden among the bones. You finally find another room with two doors, one leading to the left and one to the right.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211220;Right it is!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211220;I'll go left!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211221Desc;The moment you step through the door, you hear the familiar sound of a blade falling from the ceiling, and realize in horror what is happening.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211221;My leg!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211221;Step back quickly!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211222Desc;The room you find beyond the closed door is surrounded on all sides by skulls that seem to follow you with their empty gazes. As you look at it, however, your eyes are caught by three polished skulls sitting one next to the other. A skull of crystal, a skull of iron and a skull of silver await there. Inside their mouths, you can see three identical boxes. Under them stands a frame of wood surrounding ancient parchment. 'Neither Greed nor Vanity shall guide your hand to the hilt'. Gulping, you realize what you must do.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211222;I'll take the one in the Crystal Skull.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211222;I'll take the one in the Iron Skull.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist211222;I'll take the one in the Silver Skull.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211223Desc;The sudden click as you remove the box from the Crystal Skull is all the warning you get, before a fiery explosion hits the room. You are sent flying back and slam your head against the walls, quickly losing consciousness.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211223;It hurts! It hurts...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211223;May D'Artagnan favour us...;;;;;;;;;x
novelist211224Desc;The sudden click as you remove the box from the Silver Skull is all the warning you get, before the maw of the skull starts to quickly close shut and a blade emerges from behind the teeth.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist211224;My hand! No...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist211224;Not so fast!;;;;;;;;;x
#The thief escapes
novelist21122Desc;Entering the catacombs of Notre Dame is easy for you. However, as you make your way through the narrow passages, you find yourself stopped suddenly by a thin masked man. He bows. 'The great Clopin welcomes you, brave ruler. If you wish to find what you seek, answer my riddle. The rich needs it, the poor has it, the dead eats it, the brave fears it. What is it?';;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist21122;Nothing.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist21122;Kindness.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist21122;Death.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist21122;Your death is all you have to fear.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist212215Desc;Clopin shakes his head. 'Ah my lord, your sword is sharp, but your mind is dull. I cannot give you the prize you seek.' As you process this, you realize a mysterious smoke is filling the room. Your eyes fall shut, and when you awake, you find yourself in the middle of Paris, sleeping on the table of a inn.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist21222;A dream from the Valar? I think it's a sign I should go home.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist21222Desc;The masked man steps out of the way, and you make your way forward, following the corridor until you reach a second room. Here, dressed in the rich regalia of a Musketeer, sits a man with sharp eyes and bulging muscles barely hidden by his clothes. 'I am Portos. Prove me your arm deserves to wield the prize you seek.' He says, preparing his stance to fight.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist21222;Very well.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist21222;I changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist21222;Allow me at least to offer you a drink.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist21222;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist21223Desc;As you complete your final test, you smile, the Hilt now held firmly in your hands. With amazed expressions, your companions rush to you, recognizing you as the owner of the Hilt of the legendary blade Durendal.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist21222;What a glorious day for the faith!;;;;;;;;;x

#The Sheath
novelist2310Title;The Sheath;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2310Desc;A sailor named Sindbad was granted the Sheath of Durendal by Aragorn Napoleon before his final exile. He took it back home, but it's up to you to figure out where the home of this great merchant once was.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2310;They say all great merchants sail from Arabia.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2310;The British are shrewd merchants, perhaps he was one of them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2310;Tel Aviv is the largest merchant hub in the Mediterranean in our age.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2311Desc;You spend a long time searching equally among the ports of the city and the richest of merchant families, but in the end, you are forced to admit that the Sheath is either lost or never made it here in the first place.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2311;It's lost then.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2311;I won't give up. We shall search elsewhere!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2312Desc;You have spent a long time talking to the merchants of the city of Abu Dhabi, the richest in the eastern seas. Growing desperate, you retire to a small inn for travelers from far off port. As you are discussing the situation with your companions, a drunken man approaches you, asking for but a simple drink.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2312;I'm not in the mood for beggars...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2312;A cup for the man!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2312;Very well, I will be generous.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist2312;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2313Desc;Your days searching for information on the Sheath give you no result. Saddened, you return home, hoping that some day you wil get another chance.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2313;What a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2314Desc;The drunk man smiles as he sits next to you to drink. 'My friend, you were kind to me, and I must repay you in kindness. The Sheath you seek is owned by a family I know well.' He tells you where you can find the house, and is glad to provide you the way to the treasury, though he warns you of the many risks of such an attempt. After this, he shakes your hand and bids you farewell, disappearing in the crowd.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2314;I will steal the Sheath.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2314;Perhaps I will purchase it.;;;;;;;;;x
# Theft
novelist2315Desc;As you scout the house from outside, you remember what the drunkard told you. The treasury is on the upper floor. You decide there are three ways in: through the window, through the back door, or through the solarium on the roof.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2315;I will sneak through the window.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2315;The back door is the safest.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2315;I'll climb to the roof and enter from there.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2316Desc;You make your way through the house, an unseen shadow to the guards and servants, and find the room of the treasury. Entering the room, you find many precious objects. Three chests catch your eyes, the only ones big enough to contain the sheath. However, that's when you here steps closing in: you will have to take them away to open them, and can only carry one.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2316;Grab the golden chest.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2316;Grab the silver chest.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2316;Grab the iron chest.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2317Desc;The cumbersome chest makes you slower and easier to spot, but you manage to make it all the way to the back gate when a guard spots you, asking you to stop and explain yourself.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2317;Bribe him.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2317;Fight him.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2317;Run.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2318Desc;You return to the inn, the content of the chest secured, and quickly prepare to leave town before your crime is discovered.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2318;What a glorious day, Arsene the Shadow blessed us all.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2318;Well, it's not the Sheath, but it's still something.;;;;;;;;;x
# The purchase
novelist2335Desc;You are welcomed by the servants in the large mansion of the merchant that owns the Sheath. He salutes you, telling you the tale of how this rare treasure has been passed down in the family. As such, he tells you he will only hear your first offer for it, since to haggle would mean insulting this fine object and what it represents, and advises you to choose wisely.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2335;I offer 200 coins.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2335;I offer 400 coins.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2335;I offer 600 coins.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist2335;I offer 1000 coins.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2336Desc;The man shakes his head. 'Thank you for your time, my lord, but this is not enough. I wish you a good day.' You are quickly taken outside without so much as a moment to answer, and the servants salute you before the guards close the gate.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2336;Damn you!;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2337Desc;The man nods. 'A good offer. I will agree to the trade, and allow me to give you a gift a man such as you can enjoy almost as much, to show my good will toward your faith.' You are quickly taken to the treasury, where he opens a golden and an iron chest. From them, he takes a book and the Sheath, offering them to you once you hand the money.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2337;What a glorious day for the Novelists!;;;;;;;;;x

#The Pommel
novelist2210Desc;A great thief, perhaps Arsene the Shadow himself, stole the Pommel of Durendal from the Hilt, and legends say he sold it to the Tzar of Russia. No one knows if this is true, but if it is, the Pommel is still hidden in one of their great palaces.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2210;I'll search the Kremlin.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2210;The Winter Palace seems the most likely.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2210;Alexander Palace is a good location.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2211Desc;As a welcomed guest of the local nobles, you have many chances to search through every nook and cranny of the palace. However, your search is unsuccessful, and in the end you are forced to admit the Pommel must be elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2211;Perhaps it's just a tale.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2211;Another palace then.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2212Desc;You spend long days searching the Winter Palace, using your excuse of being here to make some deals with the powerful families of Pietrograd to cover your true intentions. However, on the last day of your visit, you find yourself in an abandoned wing of the palace, when a strange old man dressed in white comes by. 'If you are a Novelist, what you search is certainly here.' he says patting your shoulder and gently pointing to you a corridor 'Perhaps, you should look in the shadow of the greatest of all Tzars'. Entering it, you see four human sized painting of four great rulers you know vaguely from your time here.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2212;Look behind Peter the Great.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2212;Look behind Catherine the Great.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2212;Look behind Ivan the Terrible.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_novelist2212;Look behind Alexander the Martyr.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2213Desc;A corridor opens behind the painting. Following it, you find yourself in a small private study room surrounded by tall libraries, untouched by dust and spider webs like it should be. You are still looking in amazement around you, when the same man in white appears in front of you, walking in from a hidden door. He nods. 'Good choice, oh noble Novelist. Now tell me. What is it you search for?'.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2213;The greatest treasure a Novelist could ever wish for.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_novelist2213;The most precious thing of all.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_novelist2213;The sword of our greatest ruler.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2214Desc;A corridor opens behind the painting. Following it, you find yourself hopelessly lost for a long time, until you find yourself exiting from behind a statue of the same ruler you chose. You shake your head, wondering what possessed you to trust an unknown man.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2214;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2215Desc;A corridor opens behind the painting. Following it, you find yourself led to a room filled with weapons. You search excitedly for hours, only finding long rusted blades and armors. In the end, you don't find the Pommel, but you do find a blade still in good condition.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2215;At least this journey wasn't a waste of my time.;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2210Title;The Pommel;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2216Desc;The elderly man smiles and pulls a book. To your amazement, the desk in the room opens a moment later, revealing a small, rectangular box. You open it with trembling hands, and inside you see the Pommel of a sword. There can be no doubts about the origin of it. You excitedly turn to the man to thank him, only to see him gone before the corridor you entered from opens once more to let you out. Outside, you ask far and wide, but no one knows of any servant or noble with such striking appearance.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2216;Was he the great Gandalf, guiding my steps?;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2217Desc;The elderly man pulls a book from the library, and you see a door opens. 'It is good to wish for treasure, but what you truly are searching for is power and wealth. This gift will give you the same.' Afraid, you enter the room, and find a large chest. You excitedly open it, and the shining of gold answers to your eyes. When you turn to ask him more, he is gone. After taking the gold you rush back up the corridor you took on your way in, but no one has seen such a man.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2217;Perhaps the Valar sent me a warning?;;;;;;;;;x
novelist2218Desc;The elderly man nods, but does not move. After a while, you ask him why. He smiles. 'Why, the greatest treasure a Novelist could ever wish for is in front of you. Take those books, my lord, and be content with the knowledge they will pass onto you and your descendants'. As he says this, he moves away. Deciding to play along, you start to collect books, but when you turn once more towards him, you find him gone. Carrying as many of the tomes as you can, you rush back outside, and start asking around, only to find no one ever saw a man such as him.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_novelist2218;A message from the great Arslan perhaps...;;;;;;;;;x
