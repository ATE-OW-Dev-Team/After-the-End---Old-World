pancasila_DESC;The Pancasila faith is a relatively new addition to the island of Borneo. Claiming to follow the teachings of their grand antediluvian leader Sukarno and acting more as a set of philosophical and political beliefs rather than a religion, its adherents believe themselves to be the true continuation of the old world state of Indonesia. All Pancasila rulers consider themselves mere governors in a great Indonesia, regardless if they act independently or not. Those who believe in Pancasila claim that yang Maha Esa gave Sukarno the Five Principles and Thirty-Seven Commandments so that he could lead the people of Indonesia against the forces of wickedness who enslaved the people of Indonesia during his time and lead Indonesia into an age of peace and unity, which they could once again bring if they follow the Principles and Laws. Its followers are very tolerant of any monotheistic religion, seeing them as yet another aspect of yang Maha Esa and are quite charitable to the commoners as the Fifth Principle demands social justice for all Indonesians.;;;;;;;;;x

ahmadiyya_DESC;A form of Islam native to the Indian subcontinent. Ahmadi Muslims believe that a messianic figure known as the Mahdi, named Ahmad, came down to India before the Event, announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam, or else be destroyed. To those who accepted him he showed the new way of peace, and proclaimed that Islam would no longer be spread by the sword, but by more peaceful means. To those who rejected him, he issued condemnations. The Event then fell upon the people for their lack of faith, while the chosen people remained safe, hidden from the wrath. Now, under the guidance of their Caliph, the Ahmadiyya go forth once again, to preach the religion of peace to every corner of the ruined world.;;;;;;;;;x

sarna_pagan_DESC;Sarnaism is a folk religion practised primarily by the Kurukh and Munda peoples and spread throughout the Chota Nagpur plateau in eastern India. Claiming to be an ancient belief system existing since time immemorial, Sarnaism, known locally as Sarna Dhorom and to outsiders as the Religion of the Holy Woods, is a nature worshipping pagan faith largely detached from surrounding Hindu and Abrahamic religions. Though syncretism is commonplace, Sarnaists reject the Varna system and ignore any foreign religious texts, instead turning inwards, focusing on protecting and nurturing the nature around them. Having a vast and inconsistent amount of deities and spirits, the most frequently worshipped supreme creator is the Sun, known as Dharmes, a force of unquestionable good. The sacred Sarna grove is of especial importance, and it is believed the groves are the abode of Chala Pachchho, a powerful female deity commonly identified as a mother goddess of earth and nature. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which adherents celebrate marriage between the Earth and the Sun and offer sacrifices to village deities.;;;;;;;;;x

The supreme deity of the Sarna religion is the Sun god Dharmes, who is believed to be the force of unquestionable good in the world, hampered only by human vices. Sarnaists believe that the old world was struck down by Dharmes as punishment for mankind's destruction of nature, and consider it their main duty to preserve and protect nature from those who wish to exploit and destroy it. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which priests called Pahan offer sacrifices to the mother goddess Chala Pachchho and ancestral spirits, celebrating marriage between the Earth and the Sun.;;;;;;;;;x

akjang_DESC;Ak Jang is an indigenous religion that flourished among the Altai people of Russia's Altai Republic during the 1900s. The Russian Empire was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers and thus suppressed it. The religion was originally millenarian, charismatic and anti shamanic, the movement gradually lost most of these qualities becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized and accommodating itself to the pre existing Altaian folk religion. It is derived from a combination of Tengriism, Buddhism and Khurmaztism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Believed to be the religion of Bali since time immemorial, folk legends claim it is the ancestral faith of all Nusantara, having already been reduced to obscurity before the Event. Formally monotheistic, Balinese worship is focused primarily on a supreme being called Acintya, also known as Sang Hyang Tunggai or Sang Hyang Widi Wasa. Worship of the Trimurti is commonplace, whom they consider to be manifestations of Acintya, occasionally identified as Shiva or Siwa-Sadasiwa-Paramasiwa. Deities not found in Indian Hinduism are also present. Bali Hindus still adhere to the varna system.;;;;;;;;;x

girondist_DESC;The predecessor to later Jacobinism in postdeluvian Europe, the Girondists are a deistic faith which believes that the many gods of Europe are merely individual facets of a singular greater God. They believe that man was created in the image of God mentally and spiritually, but not physically. Monarchs are those chosen by god before birth to rule, however should a monarch fail in his duties as a king, or worse, become a tyrant, the third estate is obligated to either dethrone him or, if they are a tyrant, feed him to Madame Guillotine. The three Archangels of the Creator are Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity who intercede on the behalf of the Creator, helping the peasantry and telling them when a ruler has lost his divine right to rule. The religion was once fairly widespread in France, however in the centuries since it has seen assimilation of Novelist gods into its pantheon. Unlike its more aggressive Jacobinist descendant present in secret academic societies, it is relatively peaceful, hence its ability to assimilate into Novelist society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kalikula;Kalikula;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kalikula_DESC;Kalikula, meaning "Family of Kali" is the name for the Shaktist tradition of Kali worship most prevalent in northeastern India. Worship is focused on the goddess Kali as the main and most important manifestation of Brahman. Influenced by the teachings of the pre-Event guru Ramakrishna, modern Kali worship largely emphasises devotion (bhakti) over ritual, and as a result brahmin influence has greatly dropped after the Event. Other than Kali, worshipped deities include the Mahavidyas, Kaumari, Chandi, Durga, and many more regional gods and goddesses. Kali as the Supreme Being is considered both the loving mother of her children and their fierce guardian, and by extent the destroyer of evil. Worship is most often communal and carried out through festivals such as Kali Puja.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orleanist_DESC;Arcenciste, colloquially called Jeannism is a heathen offshoot of Catholicism that has a cult-like following of Jeanne d'Arc, "the Maid of Orleans" amongst other saints, it was once much more common across France but has since been largely subsumed by Novelism. Jeanne led France to victory against the Queen's worshippers long before the Event in the fabled Siege of Orleans. According to legend, she was given the sword Joyeuse by Marianne, the guardian angel of France, which she used to smite the Queen's worshippers at Orleans. Vengeful, the followers of the Queen made a pact with the Devil, deceiving the Pope into branding Jeanne as a witch for which she was murdered. Though since canonised as a Saint, her loyal followers have not forgotten about this trickery and swear revenge against the wicked Queen and her worshippers, who have once again invaded their precious homeland, and therefore the Arcencists promise to cleanse France in the name of the Maid of God once more. Opinions on this religion vary, with both Catholics and Sevillians considering them heathen pseudo-pagans yet cautiously supportive of their crusade, while all those who worship the Queen are engaged in permanent hostility with the Arcenciste faithful. The religion has seen a resurgence under the Thelemite ruled regions of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dahatatta_DESC;Deha Tatta, meaning "truth in the body", is the name of the central theme and purpose of the songs of the Bauls. Bauls are the mystic troubadours of eastern India, who perform enigmatic songs and spread a message of love. Their music and poetry, called Baul sangeet, preaches about finding relationship with God and achieving spiritual liberation, seeking divinity within each person. They believe one should always be searching for Moner Manush - the "Man of their Heart", or the divine spirit of God manifested inside the body. Followers of Deha Tatta are as such devoted to Sadhana, the spiritual practice of transcending material things through purified love and devotion. The Bauls themselves come from various backgrounds, both from within the religion and from neighbouring religions like Islam and Hinduism. This act of coming together to preach love and mysticism has resulted in a unique blend of religions that has taken over Bengal since the Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Baptists after the Event became isolated from their homeland in America, and mostly exist as religious minorities throughout Asia due to prior missionaries evangelizing heavily there. In northeastern India, they became a majority and established the first Baptist kingdom in the Old World. In other areas, smaller Baptist congregations desperately fight for survival.;;;;;;;;;x

osvicenism_DESC;A faith originating in the wake of the event in the previously extremely atheistic nation of Czechia, Osvicenism is a fusion of both Christian and Buddhist beliefs which had grown significantly in popularity within the nation. Founded by a Czech Buddhist Monk who had been raised a Catholic, he found a way to unite his disparate beliefs together under one system which appealed to the people across Czechia and Goralia. Later this system of belief would spread east by several Monks to the Buddhists of Kalmykia, converting many and becoming a stronghold of the faith. It espouses that while it was to the Buddha that God revealed how one may ascend to heaven, it was only available to the most ascetic of monks, it was only through the sacrifice of Christ that this pathway was made open to all. It views sins such as Pride or Lust as faults which must be overcome by meditation on their meaning and the emotional state which they cause. Only by conquering these faults across multiple lifespans may a person purify themselves and therefore escape the cycle of Birth, Death, Purgatory and Rebirth which all but the most ascetic monks are trapped within. Those ascetics are close to fulfilling their escape to heaven where they will join God as saints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It awaits the arrival of the Lord of Light and wishes to take control of China to prepare the way for his arrival. Moni is believed to have been the most recent reincarnation of the Lord of Light, other reincarnations include the Buddha, Zoroaster and Jesus. Devout practitioners of this faith practice a vegetarian diet. The Jade Emperor, Sapphire Didact and Ruby Chairmen are seen as evil deities due to their relationship with the successive Chinese states which oppressed those of the White Lotus.;;;;;;;;;x

wuist_DESC;Wujiao refers to the various shamanic religious traditions of the Sinitic populations of China. Chinese shamanism is intrinsic to Chinese folk religion and is fairly diverse. Various rituals and traditions are rooted in this belief system, such as Ritual Masters being identified as Wu by outsiders, though most adherents don't self-identify as such. In addition, Daojiao developed partially from Wujiao, as it focused around the pursuit of a long life, or the status of becoming a Xian, otherwise known as a holy man. Having been suppressed and stigmatized in pre-Event China, the religion post-Event had experienced a small revival but remains heavily fragmented. Wuists have generally opted to remain outside of the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanminshuyi debate regarding the war in Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

Although initially hesitant to participate in the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanminzhuyi debate, the Reformed Wuists are now actively engaging in such matters.

brethren_DESC;The Sea Creed faith is more a loose group of superstitions from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The corsairs of those seas hold together their crews through the fear inspired by the risks of going against the Code of the Sea, and of course against their ruler. Most rulers turn a blind eye on the acts and rituals of the Sea Creed, especially because the Corsairs bring in a fair profit.;;;;;;;;;x

Under rulers chosen by heaven itself (for no ruler that is not chosen could ever be King of the Calvinists for long) the Calvinist faith is prepared to fight to expand the true Christian way.;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;Surviving through the Event, like it did through so many other crises great and small, the Catholic faith however did not come out unscathed. Once the faith of almost all of Europe, now Catholicism survives divided, surrounded by new faiths, some claiming to be the true Christian faith and some swearing to destroy it. The remaining Catholics have to hold together, or be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;x

celtic_pagan_DESC;A ancient faith first revived on the Aran islands of Ireland, spreading to the nearby Galway, Mayo and Sligo. While not a direct successor, it has survived somewhat in the background of Ireland's long Christianization. It worships the spirits which inhabit all places in the world, having returned from the otherworld where they were banished by the Christian Saint Patrick. The event destroyed the barriers he put in place allowing the spirits to return once again. Of particular worship are water spirits as they give life. The ruler of these fae is Lir, Old King of the Sea, and his Swan children. The rulers of this faith are also Draoithe themselves and as such are permitted to directly hold temples.;;;;;;;;;x

genevist;Genevist;;;;;;;;;x
genevist_DESC;Genevism is a Calvinist movement founded, according to legend, right after the Event during the reign of Emperor Jürgen the Holy. The Genevists are named after the Council of Geneva, in which all Calvinist priests in Europe attended. The Council announced the proclamation of the Calvinist Theocracy as the official form of governance for the Alpereich, which caused a number of priests to storm out, leading to their excommunication and the subsequent founding of the Genevese Church. Following this schism, the Genevese Church eventually took more radical stances regarding Calvinist politics, advocating for total separation of the realm of God and the realms of men. According to the Genevese, all of God's laws cannot be realistically enforced on Earth, and as such Theocracy cannot be the ideal way to govern as it is fundamentally flawed. Though their popularity has waned in the years after the Council, relegating them to near obscurity, Genevese thought may yet be revived once theocratic rule fails the Calvinist faithful.;;;;;;;;;x

haymanot_DESC;This distinct sect of Judaism, practiced by the Betah Israeli Jews of Ethiopia has too survived the Event. Their Biblical texts have a few additions to the usual Jewish Bible. After the event, several old customs were revived, such as the unique monastic traditions that differ from the traditions of other Jews.;;;;;;;;;x
zoroastrian_DESC;Zoroastrians worship Ahura Mazda, the uncreated God, as proclaimed by the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster. It was the official religion of all Persian empires (except the Hellenic Seleucid Empire) until the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire in 651. The ancient form of the religion involved great sacred hill top fires and the exposure of dead bodies to scavenger birds for cleansing, while the modern form of this religion instead mainly focuses on the following of its primary creed, "Good Thoughts, Good Deeds, Good Words." As such, they are very generous and charitable despite the fact their religion has seriously declined in its number of adherents. The two largest surviving communities can be found in central Iran and Western India, though there was an attempt at revival in the Yarsani Kingdom of Kurdistan in recent history.;;;;;;;;;x
GOD_ZORVAN;Zorvan;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite;Neo-Zorvanite;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite_DESC;Based on a collection of texts uncovered by a Zoroastrian Priest in late 23rd century Tajikistan. This faith holds that the god of time Zorvan is father to both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu and that Zorvan guides humans destiny through various celestial implements. One key difference between this sect and its ancient forebearer is that it contends that Humans must have free will otherwise the command by Ahura Mazda to do good is pointless, thus a divine being would not state such. The faith looks slightly more favourably on Angra Mainyu than traditional Zoroastrianism due to him being one of Zorvan's sons. Additionally they believe that Zorvan's sons must both exist for there to be a universal balance, they believe that there can be no good without evil and no order without chaos to compare it to, while Ahura Mazda is the sibling worthy of worship Angra Mainyu should be respected for the role he plays in the natural order of Zorvan's weave. Because of these beliefs it was driven from its Tajik homeland by its fellow Zoroastrians and the religion found popularity amongst the Sarikoli. The religion generally speaking is not aggressive and if not for it's aggressive neighbours would continue residing amongst its mountain tribes.;;;;;;;;;x 
koranist;Qurani;Qurani;Qurani;;Qurani;;;;;;;;;x
koranist_DESC;Dating back to the early days of Islam, the Qurani believe that Islamic law and guidance should only be based on the Koran, thus opposing any religious authority of the hadiths as well as caliphs. It is their belief that God's message in the Koran is clear and complete as is and that it can be fully understood without referencing outside scriptures. In the post Event era, the Qurani are heavily persecuted and often branded as apostates. They themselves view other Muslims as corrupted and seek to bring Islam back to its original form.;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka;Pusaka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka_DESC;Pusaka, meaning Heirloom, is a term for a new syncretic school of Sunni that has only relatively recently gained a widespread following in the lands of old Indonesia. Born from a combination of Islam and various Indonesian and Malay native beliefs, spirituality, mysticism and shamanism have an important role in the Pusaka faith. Shamans, known as the dukun to Indonesians and the bomoh to the Malay, have an important role in society, considered to be healers and diviners. Weather shamans, known as the pawang, are believed to control the weather and tame wild beasts. There is a special emphasis on ancestral heirlooms, which are believed to house the spirits of ancestors and must be protected, and can give their owners extraordinary powers. Other than venerating the spirits of ancestors, the Pusaka also believe in a wide variety of supernatural entities, ranging from ghosts, known as the hantu, to imps, goblins, and familiars. Despite incorporating a large amount of native beliefs and being denounced by mainstream Muslims as blasphemers and profaners, the Pusaka still firmly consider themselves Muslim, believing that only a powerful and pious Sultan can firmly unite Nusantara once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

syafi_DESC;Pesantreni is an Islamic sect originating in Nusantara. It is named after the "pesantren", a type of religious school which played a major role in the spread of Islam within the region. Largely the same as pre-Event orthodox Sunni Islam, the Pesantreni sect has managed to largely avoid internal religious conflict and major distortions to theology in ways of local Malay folklore. Despite outward insistence on religious cohesion and Shafi'i legalism, private worship of Pesantreni Islam tends to have many esoteric Sufist and mystic rituals, including the veneration of ancestral and nature spirits and the religious consumption of cannabis. Nonetheless, the Pesantreni sect still stands tall as the most powerful faith in Nusantara, a position that comes with a theological battle against the syncretic Pusaka sect, a faith which threatens to erase Pesantreni way of life from the history books.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
navayana;Navayana;;;;;;;;;x
navayana_DESC;Navayana is a school of Buddhism founded in the decades leading up to the event. Its founder, Bhimrao Ambedkar was born a Hindu, but however following his study of the Buddha's teachings he became convinced of its truth. He found that all currently existing schools of Buddhism had become overly esoteric and no longer thought the Buddha's lessons as he would have wished them. As such he created the "Buddh aur unaka dhamm" which was a recounting of the Buddha's teachings and life with the addition of commentaries added by Ambedkar. This was meant to remove some of the esotericism which had developed in the previously existing sects.;;;;;;;;;x

mattaism_DESC;A heresy spawned from just before the event from the theology of Father Matta El Meskeen. He came to blows with the Coptic papacy over the nature of original versus personal sin and the importance of personal faith in god over that of the collective faith in the church. He believed Original sin prior to Jesus was something that an individual could overcome through good deeds and that after the crucifixion one could overcome original sin by either accepting Jesus as their savior or through their own good deeds. As such Mattaists are extremely charitable to their impoverished citizens. He also believed in the total separation of the church and the state such that the church would not interfere with state policies. Overall the importance he placed on personal faith and his critiques of the Coptic church led to Mattaists believing post event that they no longer needed a papacy to govern them.;;;;;;;;;x

fraticelli_DESC;The Neo-Fraticelli, or 'New Little Brethren', is a Catholic heresy that was inspired by records of a medieval heresy of the same name. It is devoted to poverty and asceticism - especially for men of the cloth. Fraticelli heretics are violently opposed to Church wealth and displays of opulence among the populace. This is due to Mammon Prince of Greed being viewed as the demon King of the old world, he grew so powerful as to overthrow Lucifer Prince of Pride himself. He brought about the fall of the old world intentionally therefore the sin of greed is considered as fatal, if not more than, pride. They see the old world as a society of Pharisees who, instead of helping those in need, separated from them because they bothered their hearts.;;;;;;;;;x

Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. The name 'Mandaean' is said to come from the Aramaic manda meaning "knowledge". Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the Subba or Sabians. The term Subba is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is Sabi. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".;;;;;;;;;x

But one thing is certain, and that is on the day of his death, the Angels of the Lord turned him into a statue of marble and hid him under the depths of Constantinople. This is so that in the final days of the world, Constantine could awaken once more to lead the people of God onto salvation as their blessed and immortal emperor.;;;;;;;;;x

neohuguenot_DESC;Neo-Huguenots believe that all rulers are in the service of God, and God only. Any ruler not deemed to serve God and the people are to be named tyrants, and overthrowing them is not only necessary, but a divine right. They believe that if every tyrant is removed from the face of the Earth, eternal prosperity will come to it, and so they try to go on grand campaigns to rid the world of these scum. Neo-Huguenots are heavily inspired by the Monarchomach theorists of pre-event France and consider tyrannicide to be a necessity in the fight for equality before God. They see feudalism as a tool for self-serving monarchs to consolidate more power for their selfish interests, so instead they follow a theocratic government where only the most pious and altruistic get to rule. The Queen of the Thelemites is considered to be the embodiment of a tyrant and her followers demon worshippers, and Novelists are known to have first brought back feudal law after the event, and so both are the main targets of Neo-Huguenot incursions. Catholics and other Protestants are both viewed with heavy distrust, as they both adhere to feudal structures and are also blamed for the destruction of the original Huguenots, a bitterness that never faded.;;;;;;;;;x

This means that all people on earth are stained by their sins and have been abandoned by God. The theology of this heresy ponders the implications of the event that destroyed the world of men identifying It, as many Christians did, with the Last Judgement. But in particular, adherents of this branch of Orthodoxy asked themselves if the apocalypse came to the world, why haven't the dead been resurrected and the rightful called at the right of the Father. There are different interpretations of why this happened: some believe that during the Event the apocalypse happened in full, the dead were revived and the children of God judged. What remains of the world today is nothing but the tortures of hell. Others believe that the Event has only heralded the apocalypse and the only reason why the dead haven't been resurrected is that the earth was so full of sin that God rebuked it. Thus, the world now exists as a limbo between the Judgement of God and the damnation of Hell.;;;;;;;;;x

These churches had few or no theological differences, and were mostly distinguished by which Rite they used to celebrate the Liturgy. However, after the Event, these differences no longer seemed as significant as the need for cohesion and survival in the face of societal collapse, and so the Syriac Orthodox and Chaldean Catholic Churches joined together.

tridemism_DESC;Sanminzhuyi is a faith based around the teachings of the great Sapphire Didact found in the book "Principle of Minsheng". The Sapphire Didact rose to prominence in a great war the century before the event during this war 8 great armies of barbarians led by demonic lords arrayed themselves against the Middle Kingdom, slaughtering millions, forcing the Emperor of China to seek divine assistance from the Jade Emperor to fight off these hordes. The Jade Emperor granted his aid to the Middle Kingdom and raised 8 Great Generals to semi-divinity to fight back against the hordes. The Sapphire Didact proved himself to be the greatest of these generals and alongside the sly Ruby Chairman who saw himself raised to full divinity by the Jade Emperor as reward for saving China. However, the Jade Emperor himself had too shown his weakness by allowing these demons to grow so powerful to begin with, and through the wisdom of the Sapphire Didact he concluded that his continued reign would prove disastrous for his beloved China. As such with the assistance of the sly Ruby Chairman he overthrew the Jade Emperor and forced him into hiding for a time. However it would not be long until the Ruby Chairman showed his true colours and overthrew the Sapphire Didact through deceit and cunning, forcing him to retreat to Taiwan. From there he has gradually extended his influence back to the mainland and seeks to reclaim his beloved China for the betterment of all it's peoples and a return to the harmony of the universe.;;;;;;;;;x
maoist_DESC;Liehuo follows the teachings of the Heavenly Ruby Chairman, ruler of the Heavenly Mandate of all. Though once a man, the Chairman ascended to godhood to protect China from the Eight Armies of Evil and the Event to restore harmony to the world after the Jade Emperor was deposed. He fought alongside one of the Jade Emperor's most powerful warriors, The Sapphire Didact, against these eight armies of barbarians and demons. Following their victory these two turned on each other for the throne of heaven and the followers of the Sapphire Didact were banished to Taipei, he still insidiously plots from his island realm among his followers. The Chairman's teachings are left behind in the Red Book for them to follow, so that they might achieve righteousness and not fall to the lies of either the old Jade Emperor or the Deceiving Sapphire Didact. They strongly believe in the obligation to spread the Ruby Chairman's influence to the rest of the world especially the holdouts of the Jade Emperor and Sapphire Didact.;;;;;;;;;x
taoist;Daojiao;;;;;;;;;x
taoist_DESC;Daojiao is a polytheistic religion originating in China, by the 26th century it is isolated to solely southern China following the rise of Liehuo in the north. While traditionally regarded as founded by Laozi the Supreme Old Lord in the 4th century BC, some elements and practices can be traced to prehistoric folk religions across the Middle Kingdom. The followers revere Tao, the underlying natural order of the Universe  the active expression of Tao for an individual is Te, the inner virtue. Daojiao also value life over death, and believe it possible to achieve immortality, through various methods, including spiritual practices and alchemy. One of its most important dieties, the Jade Emperor, is believed to have been betrayed by two of his servants in the century prior to the event and remains in conflict with them to this day. These two servants were his two greatest generals in the fight against a horde of barbarians led by a series of Demon lords from beyond the middle kingdom, the barbarians and their demon lords proved too mighty for china to overcome without divine assistance. The Jade emperor granted it and lifted 8 generals to semi-divinity they protected china and their two greatest leaders, the Ruby Chairman and the Sapphire didact as they are now known, were raised even higher to the rank of full divinity. But they believed that the Jade Emperor had grown weak to allow these demons to grow so powerful and sought to overthrow him. The religions of Sanminzhuyi and Liehuo represent their followers, this series of events has upset the balance of the cosmos which cannot be restored unless both of these rebellious servants are brought to heel.;;;;;;;;;x

After the death of her prophet, killed by the ignorance of traitors, Madame Guillotine was left unfed, and in the end it was humanity that paid the price in the form of the Event, when she took all the lives she was denied for too long.

Taking from both the beliefs of Orthodox and Catholics, and additionally from the teachings of the Sunni Prophet, Jugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor.

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist_DESC;Katerinists hold that, though all of the Tsars are divine, the greatest of them is in fact Katerin, the Great Tsarina. They argue that she is obviously an incarnation of the goddess Mother Russia, whom they regard as the Great Spirit who empowers all Tsars. Mainstream Zarists, however, regard Mother Russia as a metaphor for Russia itself, and anathematize any who believe that she is a literal goddess. As a result of this, Katerinism is a persecuted heresy, though it remains popular among many women, especially the wives of rulers.;;;;;;;;;x

khanist_DESC;A blend of Mongol nationalism and Tengri paganism, Khanism is the belief in the divinity of the great legendary hero Temujin, who in times past conquered the world and gained the title of 'Genghis Khan', or 'Universal Ruler'. Khanists believe that, at the height of his power, Temujin was betrayed by his friend, Han, and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now, they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x

At the core of it all was the reconquest and reformation of the Archbishopric of Lund, who, while hotly contested by rival kings for control of them, seek to reassert their power of the faith as a whole.;;;;;;;;;x
vagarna;Vaesenite;;;;;;;;;x
vagarna_DESC;The Church of Enchanted Beings, named after the concept of "väsen", claims to be the successors of millennia old traditions of the European North. Though functionally Christian, centuries of distortion have rendered them a completely separate religion. Emphasis on oral traditions and folk stories have pushed its Biblical aspects into less and less importance, while belief in the supernatural and the hidden has become key parts of everyday life. The unifying part of this folklore is belief in hidden magical creatures, such as gnomes, trolls, and elemental spirits. Protector spirits and patron deities are also frequent and vary from region to region, of note is the presence of several severely distorted Aesir amongst the regional mythologies.;;;;;;;;;x

They adhere strongly to the story of Satanael, an angel who fell in defiance of the corrupt whims of Yaldabaoth, a demonic power who fooled humanity into thinking it was God. Satanael allied itself with the hero Luther who sought out warriors and true believers to topple the pope and his false god. In honour of this story they have moved ever further south, where they are now in majority, ready to pounce on the papist realms before them.;;;;;;;;;x

Its congregation exists as a loose union of churches formed from the remnants of these ancient missionary activities. Despite the influences, Eastern Protestantism still maintains Orthodox traditions since its inception, and are preformed in the Byzantine Rite. Its adherents also share many commonalities Syriac and Chaldean Churches, which include religious calendars, festivals, and reverence of saints.

The Ma'aravim have long since integrated into the American system and thus are far removed from the affairs of old world Judaism. The Ma'aravim believe that the only way for the Messiah to eventually come is through 'repairing the world' through Tikkun Olam, a guideline to be righteous, kind and pious.;;;;;;;;;x

hasidic_DESC;Originally hailing from eastern Europe, the Hasidic movement has found itself most prevalent in the United States. Initially part of the greater American Jewish community, in time, the Hasidic movement had effectively split from the rest of Ma'aravi Judaism and largely bases itself in more rural Jewish communities across the United States. While they agree about core principles of Hasidic Judaism, many sects have arose following the teachings of several important Rebbes.;;;;;;;;;x
malikite_DESC;The Sharifi school of thought is a sect of Islam from the Maghreb which has developed some heterodox beliefs, especially regarding who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Sharifi of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

They still consider themselves Muslims, but also honour the Ancient Djinns traditional to Mesopotamia, such as 'Ishtar' or 'Ea', whom they believe are Archangels loyal to Allah. They hold that under the ancient Empire of Mesopotamia they ruled all the east as one great domain of God, yet they were ultimately shattered apart by the machinations of Shaytan, and his wife, the Queen, who led an Immortal Empire of Chaos against them. They believe that it is their destiny to reunify the Islamic world and call upon a final battle with the Empire and usher in a new golden age.;;;;;;;;;x

However, the Merchant of Death always whispers in the hears of those willing to listen, and so it was that the glory of humanity also created great destruction, until the world was returned to the darkness of ignorance.

Razumists believe that this world mind is capable of altering human consciousness and the world. This is the origin of spirits with some being the human perspective of concepts and others being the impact humans have left on the collective mind after their death, enabling them to somewhat live on post death.

Other main gods include Perkunas, god of thunder and lightning, very similar to the ancient Scandinavian god Thor and the Slavic Perun. Other important deities include Saule, goddess of the sun and fertility, Daugava and Meness. After the Apocalypse this ancient religion underwent a renaissance in its number of followers until the majority of the Lithuania, Latvia and Western Belarus were followers of the faith. The Catholics of Nearby Poland could not stand for the heathenry which their once Lithuanian brothers had adopted and they led the charge in a crusade to wipe out the faith in Lithuania once more. By 2555 the religion exists only in a few isolated pockets, largely in secret given the Catholic faith which has reclaimed Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;x

The religion survived the chaos of the event relatively unscathed in its isolated homelands however the Khanist religion spawned as an offshot in late 21st and early 22nd centuries. In the present day the Tengrist faithful of Eurasia are under threat from the Khanists to their south and the great merchantile empire of Vladivostok, both professing faiths which advocate for proselytisation.

They see all other nations to be still clinging to the name of the previous Age, and endeavour to correct this mistake while collecting all works of literature, in hopes they will reveal more of the Novel's content.

oldbeliever_DESC;Originating from a pre-Event split within the Russian Orthodox Church, the reasons for the Old Believers' existence is lost in the mists of time. They maintain that the Russian Church, under the influence of the demon Nikon, tried to pervert and destroy Christ's Church, creating the Zarist faith. However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'. In-game, the Old Believers are extremely resilient to outside influences both military and proselytic.;;;;;;;;;x

sevillian_DESC;In the final days before the event, the Archangel Raphael sent a vision to a man now known as a great Saint to the Sevillians. It showed him that Rome had become corrupt once more and that the Vicar of Christ should no longer be seated in that wretched city, instead demanding it should be seated in the righteous city of Seville, and if this did not occur a great calamity would befall the world. He attempted to warn the church of the vision, who refused to place their faith in him. In preparation for the oncoming calamity he sought to gather as many followers as possible and establish a new church in the world which would come after, becoming the first Sevillian Pope. When he revealed to the people of Spain that it was the Papacy who had led them to the apocalypse, many of the most fundamentalist Catholics who in the years before the event had grown tired with the growing progressivism of the church flocked to this new church's banners after the event, believing it to better represent the church of old. With all of Spain now following the Sevillian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x

They are thus regarded as the worst kind of heretics by mainstream Zarists due to their outward hostility towards the other cults.

The Mikraists instead believe that the primacy of the older generations of Rabbis cannot be challenged by the current generation of thinkers and thus no contradictions are allowed to arise. The Mikraists seek to find the legendary Mashiach ben Yosef, who they believe is hidden among pious Jews, awaiting to be found and lead the Jewish people to the Messianic Age by cleansing the Land of Israel from evil forces and rebuild a proper Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;x

leninist_DESC;Leninists are a sect of Stalinists who believe that while the usurpation of Nicholas the Bloody was a just one, it was the great leader Lenin who led a great revolt ordained by the Great Holy Spirit to overthrow the tyrant Tsar who had betrayed the wishes of the Great Holy Spirit. After the defeat of the Tsar at the hands of the revolution, Lenin sought to return his body and divine essence to the Great Holy Spirit only for him to be struck down by Stalin and Trotsky, who wished to steal the Tsar's power for themselves. Stalin kept Trotsky at bay long enough to steal the Tsar's power all for himself, ascending to godhood. The Holy Spirit was enraged at this turn of events and told Stalin that one day, Lenin would reincarnate among the Russian people to destroy him and his followers. Only then under the rule of the Leninov would Russia become a land of peace and prosperity once again.;;;;;;;;;x

stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the only Tsar worthy of worship as he earned his divinity through his own deeds. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on due to legends that portray Tsar Stalin as having usurped his power from Nicholas the Martyr by killing him with the help of Lenin and Trotsky and consuming his essence, as such the Stalinists were driven away by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and loyalty can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many enemies including the Great Holy Spirit who wishes to bring ruin to all Stalinist realms for Lord Stalin's usurpation. They also believe that similar to their lord they may become divine like a Tsar by consuming the essence of one. Stalin is believed to have been betrayed following his ascension by one of his followers, this traitor attempted to consume Stalin as Stalin had consumed Nicholas. He survived this assault on his being, but was so distraught by it that he saw traitors everywhere and used his divine powers to purge them. It is still debated to this day who this traitor was exactly.;;;;;;;;;x

A Sufi revivalist movement, the Barelvi traditionally believe in the light of Muhammad, the belief that the Prophet was one of Allah's first creations, and now exists as light to spread God's knowledge and intercede on the behalf of Muslims. Barelvi rituals include the chanting of dhikr, and the veneration of Muslim saints. Sufi Tariqahs such as the Qadiri, Chishti and Naqshbandi orders are also very popular. With the Muslims of Bangladesh largely turning to syncretism, the Barelvi movement has effectively been reduced to the lands traditionally considered to be Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;x

Despite that, Deobandism is not fundamentally opposed to sufism, believing that it is a fundamental part of Islam and that more esoteric practices like dhikr and Mawlid should be avoided. The Deobandi movement has been greatly influenced by the Wahhabist and Salafist movements to the point where Deobandist rulers traditionally use a form of stratocracy - the ghazwa.;;;;;;;;;x

theosophy_DESC;Theosophists are the followers of the Ascended Masters, beings that shepherd the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. Theosophy was merely one of many foreign esoteric religions to gain a foothold in the British Isles following the Event and the subsequent collapse of the Church. Nonetheless, it was eventually largely stomped out by Thelemites and their Queen. According to Theosophist teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of the Ascended Masters that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth relying more and more upon false religions before the Old World collapsed under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends hold that a Lord Maitreya will emerge to transfer knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Theosophists de-emphasise the importance of organized religious scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth. Additionally, Theosophy in the British Isles holds large amounts of influence from the Thelema faith, viewing the Queen as an ascended master in her own right.;;;;;;;;;x

theo_saint_germain_desc;This character is channeling Saint Germain, the chohan of the seventh ray, the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, portrayed as a diplomat, the embodiment of dignity and statesmanship. Saint Germain is considered responsible for the founding of many civilisations and movements throughout history, including his incarnations as the god-king of the Golden Empire in the Sahara desert, the High Priest of Atlantis, the prophet Samuel, Saint Joseph, the explorer Columbus, and the philosopher Bacon. Following the Event with the heralding of the Aquarian Age his role as the Lord of Civilisation meant he became the main divine force alongside Sanat Kumara responsible for the rebuilding of civilisation and the retrieval of the God flame back into humanity's grasp.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_sanat_kunara_desc;This character is channeling Sanat Kumara, a powerful cosmic being, the Guru of Christ, hierarch of Venus and one of the seven holy Kumaras, said to be the former Lord of the World and the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, the fraternity of Ascended Masters across the world. Theosophists believe that following the Event he stepped down as the Lord with Saint Germain, the Lord of Civilisation taking his place, tasked with bringing the God flame back to humanity, and instead is dedicated to setting his believers on the path of the ruby ray from his domain in the mythical city of Shamballa.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_lady_master_venus_desc;This character is channeling Lady Master Venus, said to be the Divine Complement and Twin Flame to Sanat Kumara. Mankind is said to be her evolution, and she herself came to Earth following the Event to bring the holy flames of civilisation back to humanity. Some Theosophists also consider her to be a goddess of love.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_jesus_desc;This character is channeling Jesus Christ, the avatar of the Age of Pisces, the Messiah and the incarnation of the Word. During the Piscean age, he revealed the Christ Self to humanity to show the works of the God presence to each human soul. Theosophists believe that following his resurrection, Jesus travelled to Kashmir, where he ascended to the theric city of Shamballa. Following the Event, the Christ consciousness had been lost to many, leading to people turning away from his teachings en masse. Veneration of Jesus is seen with suspicion by the Thelemites, who consider him to be nothing more than an arrogant mystic.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_the_queen_desc;This character is channeling Our Lady of the Stars, the highest Thelemite deity, considered a Master of Ancient Wisdom in Theosophist belief. Following the Event, the Queen ascended to become a Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, called the Aeon of Ma'at in Thelema, ruling the cosmos while Saint Germain rules the earthly domain. While Thelema belief states that the Queen is an unknowable supreme being, Theosophists believe they can channel her and even contact her telepathically.;;;;;;;;;x

thelemic;Old Thelema;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_DESC;The Old Thelema faith was mostly abandoned centuries ago by most inhabitants of the British Empire in favour of the current Thelema faith. Old Thelemites claim to be practising their faith as originally dictated by the prophet Crowley. They reject the position of the Lord Protectors as regents of the Queen, considering mainstream Thelemite beliefs to be a perversion of the goddess Nuit. Old Thelemites do not believe Nuit is to return to Earth to rule Britannia, and instead consider the British Empire to be a theologically oppressive state, hellbent on spreading their faith and state to all corners of the Earth, making them no different than the Church. This stance was cause for a massive civil war in Britain in the 23rd century, which led to their marginalisation from society. As such, Old Thelemites only persist in the fringes of Britain, and instead focus their practice on the personal will of the individual, acting to discover their True Will.;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_reformed;Thelema;Thelema;Thelema;;Thelema;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_reformed_DESC;The Thelema faith was founded by the great prophet Aleister Crowley long before the Event. With the creation of the new religion, Crowley heralded the new Aeon of Horus, and declared the main principle of Thelema: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." The Thelemite faith is centered around a pantheon of deities, the main of which is the all-knowing and omnipresent Queen of the Heavens. The Queen rules over the cosmos and is the source of all energy and matter in our world. The central scripture became The Book of the Law, a holy text Crowley claimed to be revealed to him by Aiwass, an entity he considered his guardian angel and which modern Thelemites consider to be a manifestation of the Queen. Before the Event, the Thelemite faithful were ruthlessly pursued by the followers of Jesus on accusations of devil worship, being thrown into obscurity. After the deluge, however, Thelema experienced a massive resurgence in Britain, with the Queen declaring the first Lord Protectors of Britannia to rule the material world in her stead, thereby declaring a new aeon - the Aeon of Ma'at, securing Britannia's eternal dominion over the waves.;;;;;;;;;x

congregationist_DESC;Being the largest remaining Jewish community in Europe and the de-facto leaders of the continent's Jewry has made the United Synagogue of Britain one of the most influential institutions in Old World Judaism. Just like Britain of old, the Empire of Britannia has decided to continue recognizing the United Synagogue as an authority in Judaism and has promoted it as an umbrella organization for the myriad Jewish sects dotting Britain. Since then, the United Synagogue has integrated Sephardic congregations and has promoted a more secular lifestyle while keeping with orthodox Jewish traditions.;;;;;;;;;x

federationist_DESC;Appealing to the Yiddish speaking masses in the lower classes of British society during the last centuries before the Event, the Federation of Synagogues is a rival institution to the United Synagogue.

titoist_DESC;An obscure sect of Stalinism, Titoism holds that the follower who betrayed lord Stalin was the legendary ruler of Yugoslavia Tito. They believe that Tito betrayed Stalin in order to take the power he had stolen and utilise it to free his homeland from the rule of a despotic and malevolent Car. Titoists believe that Stalin did not survive the attempt on his life made by Tito and that Tito went on to free his homeland from the Tyranny of its old Car whom the great Holy spirit refused to strike down itself. Soon after he freed his people the Great holy spirit did battle with him in a great war for heaven, this was for having assisted in the murder of one of its appointed rulers and directly murdering another. This great heavenly war was the event and since that time Tito has been imprisoned in hell by the great holy spirit as he cannot be entirely destroyed given that he contains a fraction of the spirits own power. Only through devotion and loyalty from his small sect can Tito be freed and rule on earth once again.;;;;;;;;;x

trotskyite_DESC;A small offshoot of mainstream Stalinism, Trotskyists believe that Lord Stalin was in fact a traitor to Russia, and that Trotsky, an obscure figure in the Stalinist faith was his betrayer. He is believed to have betrayed Stalin because Stalin was abusing his divine powers, bringing ruin to Russia. Trotsky tried to reason with Stalin, that his power should be turned outward to the other rulers appointed by the Holy Spirit and that they should be overthrown. Stalin would not listen and it is additionally believed by the faith that Stalin was not originally meant to be the consumer of Nicholas when their group plotted his downfall. So Trotsky and others plotted the downfall of what they saw as another weak Tsar. Trotsky managed to consume part of Stalin in his attack, reducing Stalin's power significantly and conversely increasing the power of Trotsky. The two continued to battle continuously despite the damage done to the world, the peak of this being the event itself, yet until all Tsarists and Stalinists are destroyed and only Trotskyists remain, there can be no peace.;;;;;;;;;x

Such revelation means that every single Christian Church of the Old World is a vile heresy! As such, Transatlantics declared themselves the representatives of the Pope in Mexico and his council of cardinals, and decided to take it upon themselves to spread the word of the One True Pope.;;;;;;;;;x

cadaverist_DESC;Cadaverists are a small heretic sect that believe that one of the last Antediluvian Popes is not in fact dead, but can still miraculously speak to members of the higher Cadaverist clergy. It is said that the angel Gabriel came to him during the event and froze his mind within his body to preserve it, as a way to protect him from the calamity. They believe he will some day be restored to his pre-event form once the Cadaverist faithful make up all of the Christian faithful. It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep said corpse atop a golden recreation of the Holy See and insisting that it can communicate. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x

Moving in step with smaller movements in Najd, Africa, Northern India, and more, just before the event it became a unified movement until the moniker of Salafiya. The name comes from the salaf, the first three generations of Muslims, which is believed to be the unadulterated and pure form of Islam. The Salafis believe that Sunnis should rely on the Quran and the Sunnah alone, while also rejecting any other branch or school of Islam as heretics or even non-Muslims.;;;;;;;;;x

zarist_DESC;Originating long before the Event, Zarism is a religion that holds that the world was created by a powerful spirit. Though he created all men, the majority of his children turned their backs on him and followed strange beliefs. Thus He abandoned them, and bestowed his favor only upon Holy Russia, his chosen people. Zarists hold that this Great Holy Spirit bestows his grace upon a temporal ruler, who is chosen to be Tsar. The Tsar is blessed by this Spirit, commands the full and unconditional obedience of the people, and upon death is taken up to Heaven and deified. Many Zarists express their piety through prayer to former Tsars and pilgrimages to their burial sites. Beneath the Tsars many of their servants are worshipped as minor holy men, though only on a regional level. Examples of these minor saints are Saint Benjamin in St.Petersburg or Saint Gennady in Novgorod, who both fought those who would challenge the will of the Great Holy Spirit and overthrow the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;x

Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority. That changed in the post-Event world, where a new order of monks, called the Neeraji, vigorously proselytise for the faith, resulting in a great resurgence of Jainism throughout India.;;;;;;;;;x

This new form of Hellenism believes that the event was caused by Alexander the Great being reborn as Anaxorgos and overthrowing his father, Zeus. He is the twin brother of Athena, following his rebirth from Zeus' body he convinced many of his younger relatives to rise against Zeus and overthrow him. Ares and Athena were quick to join Anaxorgos, having given him great favour in life as preparation for this battle. When Poseidon took to his brother's defence it was his son Triton, with the aid of his ship and trusty Nereid attendant Averof, who entered battle against the ancient god of the sea and imprisoned him. Persephone convinced Hades to not partake in this familial battle and so he was spared by Anaxorgos due to the aid rendered by Persephone and her Brother Philomelus. It was this great battle between the younger Olympians and those of the older generation which was the event, and said event is evidence of his cousins, siblings and his own destructive power. He now wishes to reclaim his old empire and expand it to encompass the world. The conquest was only halted by the formation of Yugoslavia, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;x

It placed the emphasis on the goal of spreading the word of Buddha by violence and coercion over traditional pacifism.

Just like how the Kali-Yuga struck Siam, many disasters have befallen their homeland. The greedy and wicked rose in power and the devoted persecuted. Despite that, many believed that Sri Ariya Meitrai, a Messianic incarnation of Lord Buddha, will come to their aid when the time is right. As such, they held out steadfastly, praying that one day humanity shall be set free from suffering.;;;;;;;;;x

They argued for the pursuit of reason, implementation of the scientific method and liberalisation of society overall. After the Event though Jadidism became an "umbrella term" used to describe to preserve Muslim Turkic identity in the face of post-deluge chaos. As such it absorbed various Turkic folk beliefs such as reverence to the ancient spirits of Su Anasy and Su Babasy, Grandmother and Grandfather of all the Turkic folk. What little knowledge of pre-event world the Turkic people had preserved was also incorporated. The most venerated figure in Jadidism is Taraqqiy.

Unwilling to accept such outlandish news, the Primate of Lagos declared himself as the head of the faith until contact with the Crown could be made again. After the fall of the Enwezor dynasty, Episcopalians refused to accept the new Yoruba led Oke-Tude faith and remained steadfast against conversion. For the faithful outside of Nigeria, the Primate can designate pious and powerful rulers as Protectors of the Faith, who serves as the de facto religious head.;;;;;;;;;x

Now, Temirizm followers seek the forgiveness of the Steel Godhead by religiously thanking it every time they use metal, be it for minor actions, for war or for the construction of their famed war chariots. The Temirizm faith religiously protects the surviving Aral Lakes, in hopes of one day restoring them to the glory of the Sacred Sea. The Faith also revers a number of other spiritual beings, that are said to represent the might and glory of mankind and the Creator. Among those are the Siblings Spirits of War Kalashnikov, Katyusha and Gvozdika, the Spirit of Fertility and Nature Tselina, and the Spirit that guards workers, Udarnik. Other Spirits are considered a menace, such as the Destroyer of Nature Kukuruznik and the Water Thief Dike Kokaral.;;;;;;;;;x

hussite_DESC;Originating among Neo-Hussite theologians in Prague after the Event, the Utraquist faith gradually became its own. Having been persecuted by their Catholic overlords for heresy, the Utraquists were driven underground as a faith. However, this persecution only emboldened them more, as many members began preaching secretly in the countryside towns of Central Europe. As a goal, the Utraquists seek to create their own domain, and are eager to spread their beliefs far and wide.;;;;;;;;;x

zaydi_DESC;Zaidiyyah, occasionally known as Fiver Shias, is one of the Shia sects closest in terms of theology to the Ibadi and Mutazila schools. Zaidiyyah emerged in the eighth century from Shi'a Islam. Zaidis are named after Zayd ibn Ali, the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali and the son of the fourth Imam Ali ibn 'Husain. Following the event it has attempted to consolidate its position in Yemen in an effort to protect itself during this era of tribulation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ismaili_DESC;The Ismaili Shi'ites are those who accept Isma'il ibn Jafar as the legitimate successor to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, unlike the mainstream Twelver Shias, who accept his younger brother Musa al-Kadhim. Historically, the Ismailis reached the peak of their political power in the age long before the Event, with the Fatimid Caliphate. However, in the intervening centuries, they have dwindled somewhat, being further subdivided into sects. In the chaos of the Event, many Ismaili sects have been absorbed by others, and now most Ismailis accept the Aga Khan as their lord. Theologically, Ismailis tend to be more focused on the interior, mystical elements of Islam than are Twelvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Originating in the split between those who supported Ali as the successor to Muhammad and those who supported Abu Bakr, Shia Islam is the second largest grouping of Muslims in the world. The overwhelmingly dominant school of Shia thought is the Jafari, or "Twelver" school, holding that there exist Twelve divinely-ordained Imams, with the Twelfth and final Imam having been divinely hidden from the world since the tenth century, and who will return as the promised Mahdi at the end of time. Nowadays, unlike the Sunnis, there is no unifying Caliph figure among Shia Muslims, so they follow the guidance of powerful and influential Imams of major realms.;;;;;;;;;;x

Yarsani believe in the reincarnation of the soul, but also of God, and that in each Epoch there are seven Haftan who accompany God on earth in mortal form. The Last Major presence of God on Earth was Soltan Sahak, who is said to have been born from his virgin mother, and when he grew of age he instructed the Kurdish tribes in the dogma of Yarsan. With the collapse of the world order, the Yarsani have declared it to be the fifth epoch, no longer bound to their mountain lands they strike forth in their search for the next incarnation of God.;;;;;;;;;x

For this reason, Alawites are also called Nusayris. Another name, Ansari, is believed to be a mistransliteration of "Nusayri".

Because of their belief in the sacred origin and spiritual powers of the Ovlat representatives, Turks of central Asia accord these tribes a special, holy status. They attended and conferred blessings on all important communal and life-cycle events, and also acted as mediators between clans and tribes.

sisukkuus_DESC;The concept of "sisu" has always been integral to life in Finland. Outsiders consider them nothing more than a disciplined people, but to Finns that discipline is just one of many things necessary to attain good sisu. Sisu is a life force that is innate to all living beings, and it forms a scale with a fragile balance. On one end, bad sisu will make a man corrupted and infirm, while good sisu will give that same man inhuman strength and combat prowess. Upon death, one's sisu will determine whether they ascend to Ylijumala's realm as a deity themselves, or fall into manala and be cursed to suffer for eternity. As an example, Sisuists believe that the Marshal was able to defend Finland against invaders for decades without losing vigor thanks to his good standing in life, while the wicked Lord Stalin was turned into a frail madman as a result of stealing divinity, becoming a cursed god worshipped only by the insane.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;

apostolic_DESC;The "Igreja Romariana", or "Romarian Church" is the legal successor to the Catholic church of Brazil. After the chaos of the Event, many Brazilians abandoned the Church, believing that Rome is gone, and with it the Pope. A small, but dedicated number of Sedevacantist Catholics held out, believing the Pope was simply too far to contact. Centuries passed, and the Romarian Church became the dominant Christian faith in most of Brazil, having absorbed many schismatic churches that rejected the Pope in Rome. It only grew to widespread prominence when the kings of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Espírito Santo and the dukes of Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe agreed to adopt it as part of their temporary alliance. By 2555, contact with Rome has been reestablished, and the Patriarch of Aparecida sits as the formal head of Brazilian Catholicism as contacting the Pope in Rome requires a perilous journey across the Atlantic. All adherents east of the Atlantic Ocean answer to the Archbishop of Cabo Verde, who in turn serves as the intermediary between the Pope and the Patriarch. Romarians reject the Sevillian Pope, believing him to be yet another schismatic like the ones that were struck  down in Brazil many years before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shindo_DESC;Korean shamanism, also known as Shindo, Mushindo or Muism, is the ancient animistic folk religion of Korea. It is said that in the years before the Event, a great War in Heaven took place between the Tyrannical Ruby Chairman and a mighty Dragon King, the culmination of which led to the near end of the world and the subsequent release of incredible amounts of spirits and energy into the world. Over time, this led to a large rise in the number of followers of shamanism in Korea, who now consider their task to be understanding and appeasing the many spirits released into the world. Korean folk beliefs include a wide variety of gods, spirits and supernatural beings, and shamans, known as mu, have an important role in their society. Shamans are chosen through a process known as shinbyeong, which the Shindo believe to be possession by a god and subsequent loss of self. Korean mythology largely differs from area to area, being mainly orally retold in the form of shamanic narratives and creation myths in rites known as gut, along with offerings to gods and spirits and rituals of song and dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinko_DESC;The Ryukyuan folk religion, also known as Shinko or Ryukyu Shinto, is the ancestral belief system of the Ryukyu islands, consisting of many deities, spirits and mythological creatures. Syncretic in nature, the Ryukyuan religion has over the centuries been influenced by a variety of religions, mainly Buddhism and traditional Chinese faiths like Taoism and Confucianism. The Shinko believe in the existence of mabui, a form of spirit or soul integral to every person, being their very essence and defining characteristic. At the center of Shinko worship are their Ultimate Ancestors, those being Utin (the father), Jiichi (the mother), and Ryugu (the sea), as family and reverence of ancestors are highly emphasised in Ryukyuan religion. Though not explicitly shamanistic, mediums and healers known as the kaminchu have an important role in their faith. Especially important are the female kaminchu, known as the noro, who formally act as priestesses and caretakers of Shinko temples, at times even acting as important political figures or priestess-queens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinto_DESC;Shinto is the main faith of Japan. This polytheistic faith revolves around Kami, spiritual entities that exist in all things. The various Kami are revered in shrines and the most important ones have extensive temples built for them. Shinto priests, called kannushi, celebrate Kami with kagura dances and seasonal festivals, ensuring their continued protection over their land. While all Kami receive some form of reverence, even if only in the form of small shrines, it is undeniable that certain Kami, such as Amaterasu or Ebisu, are more revered. After the Event, the role of Yokai, monstrous spirits, has grown into Shinto, the spirits becoming known as entities that are believed to hold negative influence over the world and thus opposed to the Kami. Divided into Mamono, Mononoke, Ayakashi and other groups, Yokai are greatly feared by Shinto followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bushinto_DESC;Western Shinto is a recent branch of Shinto that has developed through the influence of Amida Shinto over the Shinto practices of Shikoku and easter Chugoku. This faith places emphasis on the defense and unity of the Shinto followers of Japan, believing that, if Japan is unified and isolated, the Kami will celebrate this unity by bestowing their protection upon the land, granting bountiful harvests and health to the land, so long as its followers do not try to extend themselves upon other people. Western Shinto followers particularly fear the water spirits known as Ayakashi, and Seiryu, the eastern blue dragon that is said to have once punished Japan for its hubris and cruelty by destroying two of its greatest cities, and as contrast follow particularly Bishamonten and his companions, the Seven Gods of Fortune or Shichifukujin, and the gods that once shielded Japan from an invasion, Fujin and Raijin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

caodai_DESC;Cao Dai, full name Dai Dao Tam Ky Pho Do meaning The Great Faith for the Third Period of Redemption, is a syncretic movement born in Vietnam. Their beliefs draw from many different sources: ethical precepts from Confucianism, occult practices of Taoism, theories of karma and rebirth from Buddhism, and hierarchical organisation of Catholicism. The Cao Dai believe that in the ancient antediluvian age, a man named Ngo Minh Chieu was given a vision from the Divine Eye of God and was told to spread the faith far, as man will not find universal peace without one universal faith. They claim that many men have been given the will of the Highest Power throughout history, though their words have since been perverted by their followers. As a result, they revere many religious leaders, such as Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha, as saintly figures. In the days after the Event, however,  the Cao Dai have long struggled with persecution from the Red and Yellow Emperors. The Caodaist Church has since cut all ties with rulers of both empires and turned inwards in an act of self-preservation, though it remains to be seen if its followers would choose the Empire or their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

When the first of the Nihongjiao faithful emerged they came across curious trinkets which seemed to illuminate under specific circumstances, believing they had found fragments of the souls of the nine lost suns the faithful soon developed intricate ceramic vessels which allowed them to communicate with the fragments. For over a hundred years now the believers have amassed these trinkets at the center of their holy city in Shanghai constructing an enormous effigy of their Goddess, waiting for the day when all the fragments are reunited as one and Xihe will be reborn as the Neon Goddess to set the world ablaze.;;;;;;;;;x

Now that this faith has reformed it is unclear what path it will take.;;;;;;;;;x

juche_DESC;Juche was in-theory, not a religion. It was an ideology formulated by the ancient ruler of North Korea, The Kim dynasty. Juche placed emphasis on man-made destiny, following the footsteps of Kim-Il-Sung, the man who led a rebellion against Imperial Japan and made North Korea self-reliant enough to withstand the event that befell upon this world. In practice however, Juche revolves around devoting absolute loyalty toward the state and worship of the Kim family.;;;;;;;;;x

wuxia;Wuxia;;;;;;;;;x
wuxia_DESC;The Wuxia faith is an ancient cult that dates, according to its practitioners, to the very beginning of time. In those days, the First Shifu, the first man to harness Qi, codified the Code of Xia, the rules and ideals all people shall abide from. The followers of the Wuxia faith believe that true enlightenment can only be achieved through following the path of the martial artist, seeking not to harm others but to right the wrongs of the world by bettering themselves, harnessing the flux of Qi within ones body and ultimately becoming enlightened. Practicioners of Wuxia divide themselves in various sects, such as the Shaolin, the Wudang and the Jeet Kune Do. The faith embraces the teachings of many ancient masters, such as the legendary Qitian Dasheng, the founder of the Shaolin Bodhidarma, and grand master Li Xiaolong, founder of Jeet Kune Do. The faith also has commonalities with Buddhism, paying great respect to the bodishattvas, particularly Guanyin, and the Buddha himself.;;;;;;;;;x

xianxia_DESC;The Xianxia faith is an offshoot of the Wuxia faith. This religion believes that to attain true enlightenment, the practitioners should not seek to join Sect, but instead should cultivate their abilities individually. The ultimate goal of the followers of the faith is reaching the state of Xian, or immortality. The Xianxia faith has few followers, but many believe those men and women to be the strongest warriors in the entire world.;;;;;;;;;x

eastern_lightning_DESC;Dongfang Shan-Tian, or more commonly known as Eastern Lighting, is a strain of Chinese Christianity formed during the period of Great Confusion by a mystic who proposed that Lord Jesus had reborn as a Chinese woman and has come to guide her people away from their inherent sinfulness in the form that defies their expectation. Despite those claims, their envisioned Kingdom of God never came to fruition. And so, the remaining adherents concluded that their goal will never be fulfilled as long as the Great Red Dragon continues to oppress humanity while adhering to the word of their prophet.;;;;;;;;;x

legalist_DESC;More of a philosophy than a religion, Fajia, known in the west as Legalism, is built on the teachings of ancient pre-Event sages, rediscovered and expanded upon after the Event by its followers. Those that follow legalism aspire to govern following the teachings of the ancient text known as Han Feizi, along with later additions from such books as The Art of War, which they hold as their main inspirations in warfare. Those that follow the path of Fajia are often less concerned in the matters of religion, and prefer to focus on the administration, holding that the ruler's perfection is irrelevant, and it is the administration that decides their success or failure.;;;;;;;;;x

kongtong_sect;Kongtong Sect;;;;;;;;;x
kongtong_sect_desc;The Kongtong Sect is said to originate from pastoral communities on the Kongtong Mountains, and in particolar from the shepherd boy Mulingzi. The Kongtong Sect grew in influence greatly after the Event, and is today considered one of the six leading sects in Wulin. The peculiarity of the Kongtong Sect are their unusual weapons, unique to each practicioner and easily concealable.;;;;;;;;;x

jeetkunedo_sect_desc;The Jeet Kune Do Sect is said to have been born in the city of Hong Kong, from the legendary Shifu Lee Jun-fan's teachings, not long before the Event. Jeet Kune Do practicioners do not practice fixed forms, but instead believe in a fighting style described as 'Formless like water', deadly fighters at any range. After the Event, the Jeet Kune Do Sect grew to prominence, becoming one of the six leading sects in Wulin.;;;;;;;;;x
wukong_sect;Wukong Quan Sect;;;;;;;;;x
wukong_sect_desc;The Wukong Quan Sect appeared on the mountains of southern China after the Event. However, its practicioners hold that the founder of the Wukong Quan Sect is the immortal monkey king Sun Wukong. Practicing a fighting style that mixes hand to hand combat with the use of the staff, the Wukong Quan grew more and more in influence in the centuries after the event, until it surpassed many other sects and established itself as one of the six leading sects in Wulin.;;;;;;;;;x
kunlun_sect;Kunlun Sect;;;;;;;;;x
kunlun_sect_desc;The Kunlun Sect is said to have been founded by the sages Laozi and Yuanshi Tianzun, making it the oldest Sect after Shaolin (although some members of the Kunlun Sect believe the Kunlun techniques are older than even the Shaolin). The Kunlun Sect is known for its varied fighting style, that includes the use of the fist, palm, finger, sword, saber and even grappling techniques. The Kunlun Sect has become one of the six leading sects in Wulin after the Event, gaining great power and influence.;;;;;;;;;x
huashan_sect;Huashan Sect;;;;;;;;;x
huashan_sect_desc;The Huashan Sect has its origins on Mount Hua.

gaibang_sect;Gai Bang Sect;;;;;;;;;x
gaibang_sect_desc;The Gai Bang Sect, also known as the Beggars' Sect, is a powerful yet not prestigious Sect of Wuxia. The Gai Bang Sect's origin are considered a mystery, but it is considered the Sect of those that can't learn from other, more prestigious masters. The beggars and destitute people of the Wuxia faith often practice Gai Bang. It is said, however, that the Grandmasters of Gai Bang are among the most influential people in all of China, as every beggar across the nation might be a Gai Bang Sect member and be more than willing to share any information they might acquire on other lands.;;;;;;;;;x
emei_sect;Emei Sect;;;;;;;;;x
emei_sect_desc;The Emei Sect is a Sect of Wuxia martial artists whose distinctive trait is being a women-led Sect. While men are allowed within the ranks of the Emei Sect, a vast majority of the members are women. It is said almost any Wuxia woman is an Emei member, and while that might be an exaggeration, the Emei is undoubtably the most respected school outside of the six leading ones.;;;;;;;;;x
tianshan_sect;Tianshan Sect;;;;;;;;;x
tianshan_sect_desc;The Tianshan Sect is a minor Sect in Wuxia. Originating in the distant Tianshan Mountains, this Sect was believed to have gone extinct in the Event, until some practicioners reached the Wuxia land in the 24th Century. The Tianshan Sect is secretive and small, with very few relevant members, but some believe the Sect's focus on striking power might make it a strong contender against the more established schools for their place in Wulin.;;;;;;;;;x

red_cult_DESC;Hongxiejiao, also called the Red Cult, is a faith that spread in northern China. Born after the Event, Hongxiejiao was initially seen as a more militant sect of Liehuo, but over time it separated fully from the faith, seeing it as too 'moderate' in the fight against infidels. Hongxiejiao followers believe that any method is allowed to increase the power of the Heavenly Chairman, and rumors of their skills in assassination and scheming are widespread, though how much of it is true is hard to know.;;;;;;;;;x
gidoggyo_DESC;Also known as 'The Way of Christ', Gidoggyo is a set of scriptures and traditions dating back to Antediluvian customs. It is hotly debated where its true origins may lie, and what route it could have taken to its lands. Similarly to Buddhism, while appearing monolithic on the surface, upon study it is broken into many smaller temples and schools. The largest sects are the Jangnogyo, the Gamnigyo and the Cheonjugyo. Gidoggyo sects follow tenants of virtue and a rejection of 'sinfulness'.;;;;;;;;;x
