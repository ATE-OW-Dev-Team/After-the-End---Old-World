ahmadiyya_DESC;A form of Islam native to the Indian subcontinent. Ahmadi Muslims believe that a messianic figure known as the Mahdi, named Ahmad, came down to India before the Event, announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam, or else be destroyed. To those who accepted him he showed the new way of peace, and proclaimed that Islam would no longer be spread by the sword, but by more peaceful means. To those who rejected him, he issued condemnations. The Event then fell upon the people for their lack of faith, while the chosen people remained safe, hidden from the wrath. Now, under the guidance of their Caliph, the Ahmadiyya go forth once again, to preach the religion of peace to every corner of the ruined world.;;;;;;;;;x

sarna_pagan_DESC;Sarnaism is a folk religion practised primarily by the Kurukh and Munda peoples and spread throughout the Chota Nagpur plateau in eastern India. Claiming to be an ancient belief system existing since time immemorial, Sarnaism, known locally as Sarna Dhorom and to outsiders as the Religion of the Holy Woods, is a nature worshipping pagan faith largely detached from surrounding Hindu and Abrahamic religions. Though syncretism is commonplace, Sarnaists reject the Varna system and ignore any foreign religious texts, instead turning inwards, focusing on protecting and nurturing the nature around them. Having a vast and inconsistent amount of deities and spirits, the most frequently worshipped supreme creator is the Sun, known as Dharmes, a force of unquestionable good. The sacred Sarna grove is of especial importance, and it is believed the groves are the abode of Chala Pachchho, a powerful female deity commonly identified as a mother goddess of earth and nature. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which adherents celebrate marriage between the Earth and the Sun and offer sacrifices to village deities.;;;;;;;;;x

Sarnaists reject the Varna system and foreign religious texts, instead following a codified set of deities and rituals. The supreme deity of the Sarna religion is the Sun god Dharmes, who is believed to be the force of unquestionable good in the world, hampered only by human vices. Sarnaists believe that the old world was struck down by Dharmes as punishment for mankind's destruction of nature, and consider it their main duty to preserve and protect nature from those who wish to exploit and destroy it. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which priests called Pahan offer sacrifices to the mother goddess Chala Pachchho and ancestral spirits, celebrating marriage between the Earth and the Sun.;;;;;;;;;x

baptist_DESC;Born in antiquity, Baptism is a strain of Protestantism that is highly charismatic and vigorous. It believes that only adult believers should be baptised, and that too by full bodily immersion in water. They reject most of the Catholic sacraments and follow a Congregational model of Church governance. Baptists after the Event became isolated from their homeland in America, and mostly exist as religious minorities in India and Turkestan due to prior missionaries evangelizing heavily in those regions. In northeastern India, they became a majority and established the first Baptist kingdom in the Old World. In a small portion of Turkestan, a notable number of Uyghur converts from long ago desperately attempt to survive by all means necessary.;;;;;;;;;x

osvicenism_DESC;A faith originating in the wake of the event in the previously extremely atheistic nation of Czechia, Osvicenism is a fusion of both Christian and Buddhist beliefs which had grown significantly in popularity within the nation. Founded by a Czech Buddhist Monk who had been raised a Catholic, he found a way to unite his disparate beliefs together under one system which appealed to the people across Czechia and Goralia. Later this system of belief would spread east by several Monks to the Buddhists of Kalmykia, converting many and becoming a stronghold of the faith. It espouses that while it was to the Buddha that God revealed how one may ascend to heaven, it was only available to the most ascetic of monks, it was only through the sacrifice of Christ that this pathway was made open to all. It views sins such as Pride or Lust as faults which must be overcome by meditation on their meaning and the emotional state which they cause. Only by conquering these faults across multiple lifespans may a person purify themselves and therefore escape the cycle of Birth, Death, Purgatory and Rebirth which all but the most ascetic monks are trapped within. Those ascetics are close to fulfilling their escape to heaven where they will join God as saints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The remaining Catholics have to hold together, or be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;x

celtic_pagan_DESC;A ancient faith first revived on the Aran islands of Ireland, spreading to the nearby Galway, Mayo and Sligo. While not a direct successor, it has survived somewhat in the background of Ireland's long Christianization. It worships the spirits which inhabit all places in the world, having returned from the otherworld where they were banished by the Christian Saint Patrick. The event destroyed the barriers he put in place allowing the spirits to return once again. Of particular worship are water spirits as they give life. The ruler of these fae is Lir, Old King of the Sea, and his Swan children. The rulers of this faith are also Draoithe themselves and as such are permitted to directly hold temples.;;;;;;;;;x

genevist;Genevist;;;;;;;;;x
genevist_DESC;Genevism is a Calvinist movement founded, according to legend, early after the Event during the reign of Emperor Jürgen the Holy. The Genevese are named after the Council of Geneva, which all Calvinist priests in Europe attended. The Council announced the proclamation of the Calvinist Theocracy as the official form of governance of the entire Alpenreich, which caused a number of priests to storm out, leading to their excommunication and the subsequent founding of the Genevese Church. Following this schism, the Genevese Church eventually took more radical stances regarding Calvinist politics, advocating for total separation of the realm of God and the realms of men. According to the Genevese, all of God's laws cannot be realistically enforced on Earth, and as such Theocracy cannot be the ideal way to govern as it is fundamentally flawed. Though their popularity has waned in the years after the Council, relegating them to legend, Genevese thought may yet be revived once theocratic rule fails the Calvinist faithful.;;;;;;;;;x

haymanot_DESC;This distinct sect of Judaism, practiced by the Betah Israeli Jews of Ethiopia has too survived the Event. Their Biblical texts have a few additions to the usual Jewish Bible. After the event, several old customs were revived, such as the unique monastic traditions that differ from the traditions of other Jews.;;;;;;;;;x
zoroastrian_DESC;Zoroastrians worship Ahura Mazda, the uncreated God, as proclaimed by the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster. It was the official religion of all Persian empires (except the Hellenic Seleucid Empire) until the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire in 651. The ancient form of the religion involved great sacred hill top fires and the exposure of dead bodies to scavenger birds for cleansing, while the modern form of this religion instead mainly focuses on the following of its primary creed, "Good Thoughts, Good Deeds, Good Words." As such, they are very generous and charitable despite the fact their religion has seriously declined in its number of adherents. The two largest surviving communities can be found in central Iran and Western India, though there was an attempt at revival in the Yarsani Kingdom of Kurdistan in recent history.;;;;;;;;;x
GOD_ZORVAN;Zorvan;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite;Neo-Zorvanite;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite_DESC;Based on a collection of texts uncovered by a Zoroastrian Priest in late 23rd century Tajikistan. This faith holds that the god of time Zorvan is father to both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu and that Zorvan guides humans destiny through various celestial implements. One key difference between this sect and its ancient forebearer is that it contends that Humans must have free will otherwise the command by Ahura Mazda to do good is pointless, thus a divine being would not state such. The faith looks slightly more favourably on Angra Mainyu than traditional Zoroastrianism due to him being one of Zorvan's sons. Additionally they believe that Zorvan's sons must both exist for there to be a universal balance, they believe that there can be no good without evil and no order without chaos to compare it to, while Ahura Mazda is the sibling worthy of worship Angra Mainyu should be respected for the role he plays in the natural order of Zorvan's weave. Because of these beliefs it was driven from its Tajik homeland by its fellow Zoroastrians and the religion found popularity amongst the Sarikoli. The religion generally speaking is not aggressive and if not for it's aggressive neighbours would continue residing amongst its mountain tribes.;;;;;;;;;x 
koranist;Qurani;Qurani;Qurani;;Qurani;;;;;;;;;x
koranist_DESC;Dating back to the early days of Islam, the Qurani believe that Islamic law and guidance should only be based on the Koran, thus opposing any religious authority of the hadiths as well as caliphs. It is their belief that God's message in the Koran is clear and complete as is and that it can be fully understood without referencing outside scriptures. In the post Event era, the Qurani are heavily persecuted and often branded as apostates. They themselves view other Muslims as corrupted and seek to bring Islam back to its original form.;;;;;;;;;x
navayana;Navayana;;;;;;;;;x
navayana_DESC;Navayana is a school of Buddhism founded in the decades leading up to the event. Its founder, Bhimrao Ambedkar was born a Hindu, but however following his study of the Buddha's teachings he became convinced of its truth. He found that all currently existing schools of Buddhism had become overly esoteric and no longer thought the Buddha's lessons as he would have wished them. As such he created the "Buddh aur unaka dhamm" which was a recounting of the Buddha's teachings and life with the addition of commentaries added by Ambedkar. This was meant to remove some of the esotericism which had developed in the previously existing sects.;;;;;;;;;x

mattaism_DESC;A heresy spawned from just before the event from the theology of Father Matta El Meskeen. He came to blows with the Coptic papacy over the nature of original versus personal sin and the importance of personal faith in god over that of the collective faith in the church. He believed Original sin prior to Jesus was something that an individual could overcome through good deeds and that after the crucifixion one could overcome original sin by either accepting Jesus as their savior or through their own good deeds. As such Mattaists are extremely charitable to their impoverished citizens. He also believed in the total separation of the church and the state such that the church would not interfere with state policies. Overall the importance he placed on personal faith and his critiques of the Coptic church led to Mattaists believing post event that they no longer needed a papacy to govern them.;;;;;;;;;x

fraticelli_DESC;The Neo-Fraticelli, or 'New Little Brethren', is a Catholic heresy that was inspired by records of a medieval heresy of the same name. It is devoted to poverty and asceticism - especially for men of the cloth. Fraticelli heretics are violently opposed to Church wealth and displays of opulence among the populace. This is due to Mammon Prince of Greed being viewed as the demon King of the old world, he grew so powerful as to overthrow Lucifer Prince of Pride himself. He brought about the fall of the old world intentionally therefore the sin of greed is considered as fatal, if not more than, pride. They see the old world as a society of Pharisees who, instead of helping those in need, separated from them because they bothered their hearts.;;;;;;;;;x

Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. The name 'Mandaean' is said to come from the Aramaic manda meaning "knowledge". Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the Subba or Sabians. The term Subba is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is Sabi. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".;;;;;;;;;x

But one thing is certain, and that is on the day of his death, the Angels of the Lord turned him into a statue of marble and hid him under the depths of Constantinople.

neohuguenot_DESC;Neo-Huguenots believe that all rulers are in the service of God, and God only. Any ruler not deemed to serve God and the people are to be named tyrants, and overthrowing them is not only necessary, but a divine right. They believe that if every tyrant is removed from the face of the Earth, eternal prosperity will come to it, and so they try to go on grand campaigns to rid the world of these scum. Neo-Huguenots are heavily inspired by the Monarchomach theorists of pre-event France and consider tyrannicide to be a necessity in the fight for equality before God. They see feudalism as a tool for self-serving monarchs to consolidate more power for their selfish interests, so instead they follow a theocratic government where only the most pious and altruistic get to rule. The Queen of the Thelemites is considered to be the embodiment of a tyrant and her followers demon worshippers, and Novelists are known to have first brought back feudal law after the event, and so both are the main targets of Neo-Huguenot incursions. Catholics and other Protestants are both viewed with heavy distrust, as they both adhere to feudal structures and are also blamed for the destruction of the original Huguenots, a bitterness that never faded.;;;;;;;;;x

This means that all people on earth are stained by their sins and have been abandoned by God. The theology of this heresy ponders the implications of the event that destroyed the world of men identifying It, as many Christians did, with the Last Judgement. But in particular, adherents of this branch of Orthodoxy asked themselves if the apocalypse came to the world, why haven't the dead been resurrected and the rightful called at the right of the Father. There are different interpretations of why this happened: some believe that during the Event the apocalypse happened in full, the dead were revived and the children of God judged. What remains of the world today is nothing but the tortures of hell. Others believe that the Event has only heralded the apocalypse and the only reason why the dead haven't been resurrected is that the earth was so full of sin that God rebuked it. Thus, the world now exists as a limbo between the Judgement of God and the damnation of Hell.;;;;;;;;;x

inuit_pagan_reformed_DESC;A faith hailing from the far shores of Greenland. The inhabitants of those regions adopted most of the beliefs of the Inuits, syncretizing them with the Christian faith. They believe in the sea trinity of Arnakuagsak, Sassuma Arnaa and Nerrivik, the three rulers of the sea. Other gods include the unnamed Røde Sømand, the stone-faced Qooqa and the great Martin Jaegeren, while the evil gods include the wrothful Adlet, the ferocious Amarok and the vengeful Tupilaq. Its followers give great importance to the act of hunting and the respect of the spirits. Now that the faith has been reformed it is impossible to say the direction it will take.;;;;;;;;;x

These churches had few or no theological differences, and were mostly distinguished by which Rite they used to celebrate the Liturgy. However, after the Event, these differences no longer seemed as significant as the need for cohesion and survival in the face of societal collapse, and so the Syriac Orthodox and Chaldean Catholic Churches joined together. This 'new' old Church is led by the Patriarch of Antioch and All the East.;;;;;;;;;x

Traditionally,the Gelugpa are led by the Dalai Lama, but long ago the Panchem Lama was captured by the Chinese, preventing him from recognising the reincarnation of the next Dalai Lama. As a result, the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama was abandoned, and he is now elected by a council of Lamas from around Tibet.;;;;;;;;;x

After the death of her prophet, killed by the ignorance of traitors, Madame Guillotine was left unfed, and in the end it was humanity that paid the price in the form of the Event, when she took all the lives she was denied for too long.

Taking from both the beliefs of Orthodox and Catholics, and additionally from the teachings of the Sunni Prophet, Jugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor. The only one that can strengthen it is the Car of all Jugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;x

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist_DESC;Katerinists hold that, though all of the Tsars are divine, the greatest of them is in fact Katerin, the Great Tsarina. They argue that she is obviously an incarnation of the goddess Mother Russia, whom they regard as the Great Spirit who empowers all Tsars. Mainstream Zarists, however, regard Mother Russia as a metaphor for Russia itself, and anathematize any who believe that she is a literal goddess. As a result of this, Katerinism is a persecuted heresy, though it remains popular among many women, especially the wives of rulers.;;;;;;;;;x
khanist;Khanist;;;;;;;;;x
khanist_DESC;A blend of Mongol nationalism and Tengri paganism, Khanism is the belief in the divinity of the great legendary hero Temujin, who in times past conquered the world and gained the title of 'Genghis Khan', or 'Universal Ruler'. Khanists believe that, at the height of his power, Temujin was betrayed by his friend, Han, and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now, they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x

Requiring strict discipline of their followers and of the priests they recreated their bishoprics across the major kingdoms, which in turn flowed into the militaries and economies of the enterprising rulers. At the core of it all was the reconquest and reformation of the Archbishopric of Lund, who, while hotly contested by rival kings for control of them, seek to reassert their power of the faith as a whole.;;;;;;;;;x

gnostic_DESC;The Einblicker, or the Insightful, are a radical strain of Vagarna who split off long ago. They adhere strongly to the story of Satanael, an angel who fell in defiance of the corrupt whims of Yaldabaoth, a demonic power who fooled humanity into thinking it was God. Satanael allied itself with the hero Luther who sought out warriors and true believers to topple the pope and his false god. In honour of this story they have moved ever further south, where they are now in majority, ready to pounce on the papist realms before them.;;;;;;;;;x

easternprotestant_DESC;With obscure origins dating back to antediluvian missionaries from Western Europe, Eastern Protestantism is an amalgamation of various Protestant sects with Orthodoxy. Its congregation exists as a loose union of churches formed from the remnants of these ancient missionary activities. Despite the influences, Eastern Protestantism still maintains Orthodox traditions since its inception, and are preformed in the Byzantine Rite. Its adherents also share many commonalities Syriac and Chaldean Churches, which include religious calendars, festivals, and reverence of saints. At the same time, Eastern Protestants also revere Western Protestant figures like Lucas Cranach the Elder, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Roger Williams.;;;;;;;;;x

The Ma'aravim have long since integrated into the American system and thus are far removed from the affairs of old world Judaism.

Initially part of the greater American Jewish community, in time, the Hasidic movement had effectively split from the rest of Ma'aravi Judaism and largely bases itself in more rural Jewish communities across the United States. While they agree about core principles of Hasidic Judaism, many sects have arose following the teachings of several important Rebbes.;;;;;;;;;x
malikite_DESC;The Malikite school of thought was originally simply one of many schools of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, and in most parts of the world that is still the case. However, in Post-Event Morocco, the term has come to signify the teachings of a group that, though they still call themselves Sunni Muslims of the Maliki school, have developed some heterodox beliefs, especially as regards who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Malikites of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

They still consider themselves Muslims, but also honour the Ancient Djinns traditional to Mesopotamia, such as 'Ishtar' or 'Ea', whom they believe are Archangels loyal to Allah. They hold that under the ancient Empire of Mesopotamia they ruled all the east as one great domain of God, yet they were ultimately shattered apart by the machinations of Shaytan, and his wife, the Queen, who led an Immortal Empire of Chaos against them. They believe that it is their destiny to reunify the Islamic world and call upon a final battle with the Empire and usher in a new golden age.;;;;;;;;;x

With the chaos of the Event cutting India off from most outside communication, the various Nasrani Churches (both those in communion with the Pope and those in communion with the Eastern Church) united together for the sake of convenience. The example of several holy men has caused the Nasranis to grow in popularity over the last few decades, to the point where they are a majority in Kerala, in the southwestern coast of India, though they are still a minority overall.;;;;;;;;;x

However, the Merchant of Death always whispers in the hears of those willing to listen, and so it was that the glory of humanity also created great destruction, until the world was returned to the darkness of ignorance. The Nobelians struggle to return humanity to its former glory, believing they can recreate the greatness of the old world.;;;;;;;;;x

nousthreskeia_DESC;Originating in the distant and unknowable snowlands east of Russia, Razumism is a religion focused on the belief in a phenomenon known as "Mirovoy Razum" by which all human consciousness is thought to be linked. Razumists believe that this world mind is capable of altering human consciousness and the world. This is the origin of spirits with some being the human perspective of concepts and others being the impact humans have left on the collective mind after their death, enabling them to somewhat live on post death. They believe that the Event was caused by the uncontrolled collective mind growing restless and harming humanity. They believe that if humanity is to return to a pre-event stage of advancement it must first mature collectively.;;;;;;;;;x

baltic_pagan_DESC;Romuva is polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods led by Dievs, god of the sky. Other main gods include Perkunas, god of thunder and lightning, very similar to the ancient Scandinavian god Thor and the Slavic Perun. Other important deities include Saule, goddess of the sun and fertility, Daugava and Meness. After the Apocalypse this ancient religion underwent a renaissance in its number of followers until the majority of the Lithuania, Latvia and Western Belarus were followers of the faith. The Catholics of Nearby Poland could not stand for the heathenry which their once Lithuanian brothers had adopted and they led the charge in a crusade to wipe out the faith in Lithuania once more. By 2555 the religion exists only in a few isolated pockets, largely in secret given the Catholic faith which has reclaimed Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;x

oldbeliever_DESC;Originating from a pre-Event split within the Russian Orthodox Church, the reasons for the Old Believers' existence is lost in the mists of time. They maintain that the Russian Church, under the influence of the demon Nikon, tried to pervert and destroy Christ's Church, creating the Zarist faith. However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'.

sevillian_DESC;In the final days before the event, the Archangel Raphael sent a vision to a man now known as a great Saint to the Sevillians. It showed him that Rome had become corrupt once more and that the Vicar of Christ should no longer be seated in that wretched city, instead demanding it should be seated in the righteous city of Seville, and if this did not occur a great calamity would befall the world. He attempted to warn the church of the vision, who refused to place their faith in him. In preparation for the oncoming calamity he sought to gather as many followers as possible and establish a new church in the world which would come after, becoming the first Sevillian Pope. When he revealed to the people of Spain that it was the Papacy who had led them to the apocalypse, many of the most fundamentalist Catholics who in the years before the event had grown tired with the growing progressivism of the church flocked to this new church's banners after the event, believing it to better represent the church of old. With all of Spain now following the Sevillian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x

They are thus regarded as the worst kind of heretics by mainstream Zarists due to their outward hostility towards the other cults.

The Mikraists instead believe that the primacy of the older generations of Rabbis cannot be challenged by the current generation of thinkers and thus no contradictions are allowed to arise. The Mikraists seek to find the legendary Mashiach ben Yosef, who they believe is hidden among pious Jews, awaiting to be found and lead the Jewish people to the Messianic Age by cleansing the Land of Israel from evil forces and rebuild a proper Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;x

leninist_DESC;Leninists are a sect of Stalinists who believe that while the usurpation of Nicholas the Bloody was a just one, it was the great leader Lenin who led a great revolt ordained by the Great Holy Spirit to overthrow the tyrant Tsar who had betrayed the wishes of the Great Holy Spirit. After the defeat of the Tsar at the hands of the revolution, Lenin sought to return his body and divine essence to the Great Holy Spirit only for him to be struck down by Stalin and Trotsky, who wished to steal the Tsar's power for themselves. Stalin kept Trotsky at bay long enough to steal the Tsar's power all for himself, ascending to godhood. The Holy Spirit was enraged at this turn of events and told Stalin that one day, Lenin would reincarnate among the Russian people to destroy him and his followers. Only then under the rule of the Leninov would Russia become a land of peace and prosperity once again.;;;;;;;;;x

stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the only Tsar worthy of worship as he earned his divinity through his own deeds. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on due to legends that portray Tsar Stalin as having usurped his power from Nicholas the Martyr by killing him with the help of Lenin and Trotsky and consuming his essence, as such the Stalinists were driven away by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and loyalty can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many enemies including the Great Holy Spirit who wishes to bring ruin to all Stalinist realms for Lord Stalin's usurpation. They also believe that similar to their lord they may become divine like a Tsar by consuming the essence of one. Stalin is believed to have been betrayed following his ascension by one of his followers, this traitor attempted to consume Stalin as Stalin had consumed Nicholas. He survived this assault on his being, but was so distraught by it that he saw traitors everywhere and used his divine powers to purge them. It is still debated to this day who this traitor was exactly.;;;;;;;;;x

sufi_DESC;Properly speaking, Sufism is a tradition of mystical thought common to all kinds of Islam, but only in Central Africa have such schools come to dominate the religious landscape. Focusing on the inward, mystical dimension of Islam, the isolation of the post-Event world has caused African Sufis to develop unique characteristics that distinguish them from more mainstream Islam. Some sects have adopted beliefs from native African paganism, while others are more conservative and stick closer to Sunni orthodoxy. Yet others draw inspiration from the Salafist and Wahhabi movements in West Africa, attempting to 'purify' Islam from foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;x

theosophy_DESC;Theosophists are the followers of the Ascended Masters, beings that shepherd the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. Theosophy was merely one of many foreign esoteric religions to gain a foothold in the British Isles following the Event and the subsequent collapse of the Church. Nonetheless, it was eventually largely stomped out by Thelemites and their Queen. According to Theosophist teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of the Ascended Masters that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth relying more and more upon false religions before the Old World collapsed under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends hold that a Lord Maitreya will emerge to transfer knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Theosophists de-emphasise the importance of organized religious scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth. Additionally, Theosophy in the British Isles holds large amounts of influence from the Thelema faith, viewing the Queen as an ascended master in her own right.;;;;;;;;;x

Saint Germain is considered responsible for the founding of many civilisations and movements throughout history, including his incarnations as the god-king of the Golden Empire in the Sahara desert, the High Priest of Atlantis, the prophet Samuel, Saint Joseph, the explorer Columbus, and the philosopher Bacon. Following the Event with the heralding of the Aquarian Age his role as the Lord of Civilisation meant he became the main divine force alongside Sanat Kumara responsible for the rebuilding of civilisation and the retrieval of the God flame back into humanity's grasp.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_sanat_kunara_desc;This character is channeling Sanat Kumara, a powerful cosmic being, the Guru of Christ, hierarch of Venus and one of the seven holy Kumaras, said to be the former Lord of the World and the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, the fraternity of Ascended Masters across the world. Theosophists believe that following the Event he stepped down as the Lord with Saint Germain, the Lord of Civilisation taking his place, tasked with bringing the God flame back to humanity, and instead is dedicated to setting his believers on the path of the ruby ray from his domain in the mythical city of Shamballa.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_lady_master_venus_desc;This character is channeling Lady Master Venus, said to be the Divine Complement and Twin Flame to Sanat Kumara. Mankind is said to be her evolution, and she herself came to Earth following the Event to bring the holy flames of civilisation back to humanity. Some Theosophists also consider her to be a goddess of love.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_jesus_desc;This character is channeling Jesus Christ, the avatar of the Age of Pisces, the Messiah and the incarnation of the Word. During the Piscean age, he revealed the Christ Self to humanity to show the works of the God presence to each human soul. Theosophists believe that following his resurrection, Jesus travelled to Kashmir, where he ascended to the theric city of Shamballa. Following the Event, the Christ consciousness had been lost to many, leading to people turning away from his teachings en masse. Veneration of Jesus is seen with suspicion by the Thelemites, who consider him to be nothing more than an arrogant mystic.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_the_queen_desc;This character is channeling Our Lady of the Stars, the highest Thelemite deity, considered a Master of Ancient Wisdom in Theosophist belief. Following the Event, the Queen ascended to become a Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, called the Aeon of Ma'at in Thelema, ruling the cosmos while Saint Germain rules the earthly domain. While Thelema belief states that the Queen is an unknowable supreme being, Theosophists believe they can channel her and even contact her telepathically.;;;;;;;;;x

titoist_DESC;An obscure sect of Stalinism, Titoism holds that the follower who betrayed lord Stalin was the legendary ruler of Yugoslavia Tito. They believe that Tito betrayed Stalin in order to take the power he had stolen and utilise it to free his homeland from the rule of a despotic and malevolent Car. Titoists believe that Stalin did not survive the attempt on his life made by Tito and that Tito went on to free his homeland from the Tyranny of its old Car whom the great Holy spirit refused to strike down itself. Soon after he freed his people the Great holy spirit did battle with him in a great war for heaven, this was for having assisted in the murder of one of its appointed rulers and directly murdering another. This great heavenly war was the event and since that time Tito has been imprisoned in hell by the great holy spirit as he cannot be entirely destroyed given that he contains a fraction of the spirits own power. Only through devotion and loyalty from his small sect can Tito be freed and rule on earth once again.;;;;;;;;;x

trotskyite_DESC;A small offshoot of mainstream Stalinism, Trotskyists believe that Lord Stalin was in fact a traitor to Russia, and that Trotsky, an obscure figure in the Stalinist faith was his betrayer. He is believed to have betrayed Stalin because Stalin was abusing his divine powers, bringing ruin to Russia. Trotsky tried to reason with Stalin, that his power should be turned outward to the other rulers appointed by the Holy Spirit and that they should be overthrown. Stalin would not listen and it is additionally believed by the faith that Stalin was not originally meant to be the consumer of Nicholas when their group plotted his downfall. So Trotsky and others plotted the downfall of what they saw as another weak Tsar. Trotsky managed to consume part of Stalin in his attack, reducing Stalin's power significantly and conversely increasing the power of Trotsky. The two continued to battle continuously despite the damage done to the world, the peak of this being the event itself, yet until all Tsarists and Stalinists are destroyed and only Trotskyists remain, there can be no peace.;;;;;;;;;x

Such revelation means that every single Christian Church of the Old World is a vile heresy! As such, Transatlantics declared themselves the representatives of the Pope in Mexico and his council of cardinals, and decided to take it upon themselves to spread the word of the One True Pope.;;;;;;;;;x

cadaverist_DESC;Cadaverists are a small heretic sect that believe that one of the last Antediluvian Popes is not in fact dead, but can still miraculously speak to members of the higher Cadaverist clergy. It is said that the angel Gabriel came to him during the event and froze his mind within his body to preserve it, as a way to protect him from the calamity. They believe he will some day be restored to his pre-event form once the Cadaverist faithful make up all of the Christian faithful. It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep said corpse atop a golden recreation of the Holy See and insisting that it can communicate. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x

Moving in step with smaller movements in Najd, Africa, Northern India, and more, just before the event it became a unified movement until the moniker of Salafiya. The name comes from the salaf, the first three generations of Muslims, which is believed to be the unadulterated and pure form of Islam. The Salafis believe that Sunnis should rely on the Quran and the Sunnah alone, while also rejecting any other branch or school of Islam as heretics or even non-Muslims.;;;;;;;;;x

zarist_DESC;Originating long before the Event, Zarism is a religion that holds that the world was created by a powerful spirit. Though he created all men, the majority of his children turned their backs on him and followed strange beliefs. Thus He abandoned them, and bestowed his favor only upon Holy Russia, his chosen people. Zarists hold that this Great Holy Spirit bestows his grace upon a temporal ruler, who is chosen to be Tsar. The Tsar is blessed by this Spirit, commands the full and unconditional obedience of the people, and upon death is taken up to Heaven and deified. Many Zarists express their piety through prayer to former Tsars and pilgrimages to their burial sites. Beneath the Tsars many of their servants are worshipped as minor holy men, though only on a regional level. Examples of these minor saints are Saint Benjamin in St.Petersburg or Saint Gennady in Novgorod, who both fought those who would challenge the will of the Great Holy Spirit and overthrow the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;x

Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority. That changed in the post-Event world, where a new order of monks, called the Neeraji, vigorously proselytise for the faith, resulting in a great resurgence of Jainism throughout India.;;;;;;;;;x

He is the twin brother of Athena, following his rebirth from Zeus' body he convinced many of his younger relatives to rise against Zeus and overthrow him. Ares and Athena were quick to join Anaxorgos, having given him great favour in life as preparation for this battle. When Poseidon took to his brother's defence it was his son Triton, with the aid of his ship and trusty Nereid attendant Averof, who entered battle against the ancient god of the sea and imprisoned him. Persephone convinced Hades to not partake in this familial battle and so he was spared by Anaxorgos due to the aid rendered by Persephone and her Brother Philomelus. It was this great battle between the younger Olympians and those of the older generation which was the event, and said event is evidence of his cousins, siblings and his own destructive power. He now wishes to reclaim his old empire and expand it to encompass the world. The conquest was only halted by the formation of Yugoslavia, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;x

They argued for the pursuit of reason, implementation of the scientific method and liberalisation of society overall. After the Event though Jadidism became an "umbrella term" used to describe to preserve Muslim Turkic identity in the face of post-deluge chaos. As such it absorbed various Turkic folk beliefs such as reverence to the ancient spirits of Su Anasy and Su Babasy, Grandmother and Grandfather of all the Turkic folk. What little knowledge of pre-event world the Turkic people had preserved was also incorporated. The most venerated figure in Jadidism is Taraqqiy.

Following their victory these two turned on each other for the throne of heaven and the followers of the Sapphire Didact were banished to Taipei, he still insidiously plots from his island realm among his followers. The Chairman's teachings are left behind in the Red Book for them to follow, so that they might achieve righteousness and not fall to the lies of either the old Jade Emperor or the Deceiving Sapphire Didact.

Unwilling to accept such outlandish news, the Primate of Lagos declared himself as the head of the faith until contact with the Crown could be made again. After the fall of the Enwezor dynasty, Episcopalians refused to accept the new Yoruba led Oke-Tude faith and remained steadfast against conversion. For the faithful outside of Nigeria, the Primate can designate pious and powerful rulers as Protectors of the Faith, who serves as the de facto religious head.;;;;;;;;;x

The Temirizm faith religiously protects the surviving Aral Lakes, in hopes of one day restoring them to the glory of the Sacred Sea. The Faith also revers a number of other spiritual beings, that are said to represent the might and glory of mankind and the Creator. Among those are the Siblings Spirits of War Kalashnikov, Katyusha and Gvozdika, the Spirit of Fertility and Nature Tselina, and the Spirit that guards workers, Udarnik.

ismaili_DESC;The Ismaili Shi'ites are those who accept Isma'il ibn Jafar as the legitimate successor to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, unlike the mainstream Twelver Shias, who accept his younger brother Musa al-Kadhim. Historically, the Ismailis reached the peak of their political power in the age long before the Event, with the Fatimid Caliphate. However, in the intervening centuries, they have dwindled somewhat, being further subdivided into sects. In the chaos of the Event, many Ismaili sects have been absorbed by others, and now most Ismailis accept the Aga Khan as their lord. Theologically, Ismailis tend to be more focused on the interior, mystical elements of Islam than are Twelvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Originating in the split between those who supported Ali as the successor to Muhammad and those who supported Abu Bakr, Shia Islam is the second largest grouping of Muslims in the world. The overwhelmingly dominant school of Shia thought is the Jafari, or "Twelver" school, holding that there exist Twelve divinely-ordained Imams, with the Twelfth and final Imam having been divinely hidden from the world since the tenth century, and who will return as the promised Mahdi at the end of time. Nowadays, unlike the Sunnis, there is no unifying Caliph figure among Shia Muslims, so they follow the guidance of powerful and influential Imams of major realms.;;;;;;;;;;x

The Last Major presence of God on Earth was Soltan Sahak, who is said to have been born from his virgin mother, and when he grew of age he instructed the Kurdish tribes in the dogma of Yarsan. With the collapse of the world order, the Yarsani have declared it to be the fifth epoch, no longer bound to their mountain lands they strike forth in their search for the next incarnation of God.;;;;;;;;;x

sisukkuus_DESC;The concept of "sisu" has always been integral to life in Finland. Outsiders consider them nothing more than a disciplined people, but to Finns that discipline is just one of many things necessary to attain good sisu. Sisu is a life force that is innate to all living beings, and it forms a scale with a fragile balance. On one end, bad sisu will make a man corrupted and infirm, while good sisu will give that same man inhuman strength and combat prowess. Upon death, one's sisu will determine whether they ascend to Ylijumala's realm as a deity themselves, or fall into manala and be cursed to suffer for eternity. As an example, Sisuists believe that the Marshal was able to defend Finland against invaders for decades without losing vigor thanks to his good standing in life, while the wicked Lord Stalin was turned into a frail madman as a result of stealing divinity, becoming a cursed god worshipped only by the insane.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;

apostolic_DESC;The "Igreja Romariana", or "Romarian Church" is the legal successor to the Catholic church of Brazil. After the chaos of the Event, many Brazilians abandoned the Church, believing that Rome is gone, and with it the Pope. A small, but dedicated number of Sedevacantist Catholics held out, believing the Pope was simply too far to contact. Centuries passed, and the Romarian Church became the dominant Christian faith in most of Brazil, having absorbed many schismatic churches that rejected the Pope in Rome. It only grew to widespread prominence when the kings of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Espírito Santo and the dukes of Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe agreed to adopt it as part of their temporary alliance. By 2555, contact with Rome has been reestablished, and the Patriarch of Aparecida sits as the formal head of Brazilian Catholicism as contacting the Pope in Rome requires a perilous journey across the Atlantic. All adherents east of the Atlantic Ocean answer to the Archbishop of Cabo Verde, who in turn serves as the intermediary between the Pope and the Patriarch. Romarians reject the Sevillian Pope, believing him to be yet another schismatic like the ones that were struck  down in Brazil many years before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

starist_pagan_reformed_DESC;For the people living in the arctic wastes of Russia, there are few things to find besides the night sky and the marvelous stellar bodies that inhabit it. So it comes as no surprise that a number of folktales and traditions have sprung up surrounding the myths relating to the sky and the stars. On how the King Zvezda of the Stars has created the night sky and this world and presides over it to maintain the universal balance of Sun and Moon. This faith has now been standardized and officialized and the 'Church' of the Stars is now considered its own full religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,;
