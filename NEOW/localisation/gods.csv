pancasila_DESC;The people of Indonesia worship the one god Yang Maha Esa, who they believe rules over the sky in the form of Garuda, the King of Birds, and the earth in the form of Paduka Tuan, the King of Men. As people spend all their lives in service of Yang Maha Esa - serving Paduka Tuan in life and Garuda in death, they believe that in order to prove themselves worthy of flying with Garuda in the skies above Heaven, they must live their lives diligently following the Five Precepts as laid down by Paduka Tuan - guided by justice, civility, inner wisdom, belief in fellow man, and belief in God. Only by understanding the relationship between oneself and God can one realise that they are different, yet still one - just like the Indonesia that Paduka Tuan gifted to them long ago, and they may yet work to restore it and the unity it brought to mankind.;;;;;;;;;x

old_hindu;Vaishnava;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_hindu_DESC;Vaishnavism, the worship of Vishnu as the Supreme Being and his ten primary avatars, used to be one of the largest Hindu sects prior to the Event. The most prominent feature is the still-prevalent caste adherence in Vaishnavist communities. Additionally, the ninth avatar of Vishnu varies, with the most predominant one being Buddha, and regional variants including Jagannath and The Mahatma. However, with the worship of Krishna as the supreme (and sometimes only) god rising in popularity, its number of adherents has been reduced greatly. Nonetheless, Vaishnavism may one day dominate Hinduism once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

maunaxite_DESC;Not so much a singular faith as a blanket term for various disorganised faiths and practices across eastern India. The most common binding belief is that Shiva, who struck down the old world for their decadent ways, is the Supreme Being. Shakta tradition also has noticeable influence, with Shiva often being portrayed as the male reality of God while Shakti (in various forms) is the female reality. Local deities, such as Jagannath, are frequently worshipped. Tantric ritualism and low priestly influence are defining characteristics. Though worship most commonly takes places in village shrines, old temples are meticulously maintained and frequently used as pilgrimage sites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neovedantic;Sri Bhagavata;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
neovedantic_DESC;Though originating from before the Event, worship of Krishna as the monotheistic God under the name Svayam Bhagavan has almost completely overtaken Vaishnavism since then, rejecting Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu. Though Bhagavan-Krishna is considered the sole Supreme Being, adherents frequently worship various aspects and forms of Krishna. Bhakti tradition also holds high value in Bhagavatism, with ritualism being largely replaced with popular worship through song, festival, and dance among other devotional traditions. As a result, the Varna system has been highly de-emphasised and brahmin influence has dropped greatly since the Event.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
parabrahmanist;Smarta;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
parabrahmanist_DESC;Smartism follows the teachings of the scholar-saint Adi Shankara. Though originating from before the Event, Smartism has come to dominate South India by syncretising various Hindu sects into the philosophical tradition of Advaita Vedanta. The Smarta tradition is largely controlled by the brahmins, who uphold philosophical orthodoxy through a centralised priestly hierarchy. The head of the Smarta priestly hierarchy is the Shankaracharya. Smarta worship features strict rituals called yajna administered by the brahmins, and usually venerates five deities with equal value - Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Ganesha, and Surya.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

shaivasiddhanta_DESC;Shaiva Siddhanta is a school of Shaivism found primarily in Tamil Nadu in southern India. The central belief is the existence of three universal realities - the Lord (pati), the soul (pashu) and the soul's impurities and bindings in existence (pasha), those being karma, ignorance, and maya (delusion in reality). Adherents believe that ritualism and devotion (bhakti) are the path for one's soul to be free from its bindings. Veneration of Shaiva saints, regional deities and Tamil poets are also present. After the Event, it grew to be the dominant Hindu sect in Tamil Nadu.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

jagannatha_DESC;Jagannath is the Lord of the Universe of the jungles and hills of eastern India. Some say he is a manifestation of Vishnu, others that he is a fierce form of Shiva, but all will agree that Jagannath is an unstoppable force - the will and embodiment of the universe and brahman itself. Along with his brother Balabhadra and his sister Subhadra, they represent all the consciousness, energy, and knowledge of the universe respectively - a great triad equivalent to Para Brahman. Jagannath is an abstract concept, the personification of the void, present everywhere all at once. He is celebrated in great chariot processions called Ratha Yatras and worshipped in the form of vividly decorated painted wood icons. For centuries, the followers of Jagannath have been persecuted by armies of invading faiths, considering their Lord to be a demonic force, his temples being desecrated and his worshippers massacred and driven out in droves. Nonetheless, Jagannath's faithful do not intend to lay down and die, their tradition being one of the most militant in all of India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

saura_DESC;The Saurya tradition of Hinduism worships the Sun god Surya as the Saguna Brahman and Supreme Being. Surya is the Lord of the Trimurti and the absolute reality of the world. Worship of Surya dates back to the Vedas, particularly the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred mantra dedicated to Savitr - God of the Sunrays. He is depicted as riding a chariot through the sky pulled by seven horses, and is worshipped in tandem with other gods throughout various periods of the day - alongside Brahma in the day, Shiva at noon, and Vishnu in the evening. Surya is also worshipped in the Makarasankranti, a lavish festival celebrating the transition of the Sun from the dhanu zodiac to the makara, thanking Surya for prosperity and new beginnings. Though one of the oldest Hindu deities still worshipped, veneration of Surya declined greatly before the Event - and his followers believe it is for this reason the Sun itself fell down to Earth and struck the Old World down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

risala;Risala Khalida;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
risala_DESC;The Risala Khalida is a movement within Sunni Islam, seeking to lead the people of the book to salvation under God. The failure of traditional Muslim sects to unify the ummah has made Islam the weakest it has been since the Jahiliyyah. The people of the Eternal Message hold that the Prophet was sent to the Arab nation to unify it as a lawgiver, abolishing tribalism and asabiyya and protecting the Arabs from encroaching imperialists. Under the Prophet and the Rashidun, all Muslims were equal under God, free from the greed and exploitation that other empires fall to. Thus, Islam must once again be freed from its struggles by a great leader, one that will follow in the footsteps of the Prophet and free the ummah from this modern Fitna. They see each of the religious traditions descended from Abraham as valid ways to salvation, universal and inherent to the belief in an infinitely merciful God, though it is Islam which now holds the responsibility of liberating the Muwahhidun of the Near East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In Gond folk tradition, adherents worship a high god known as Baradeo, whose alternate names are Bhagavan, Kupar Lingo, Badadeo, and Persa Pen. Baradeo oversees activities of lesser gods such as clan and village deities as well as ancestors. Baradeo is respected but he does not receive fervent devotion, which is shown only to clan and village deities, ancestors, and totems. These village deities include Aki Pen, the village guardian and the anwal, the village mother goddess, a similar paradigm to folk traditions of other Dravidian peoples. Before any festival occurs, these two deities are worshipped. Each clan has their own persa pen, meaning "great god". This god is benign at heart but can display violent tendencies.;;;;;;;;;x

sarvodaya_DESC;Sarvodaya, meaning "universal uplift" is an Indian post-Event movement that arose after the fall of Indian democracy. Described by contemporary scholars as something between a religion and a philosophy, adherents of Sarvodaya consider themselves the true successors of the Indian state. While their beliefs are still largely Dharmic in nature, considering all Hindu gods valid manifestations of Brahman or Shakti, they are ultimately secular, not encouraging or discouraging any worship among their followers. Sarvodaya adherents worship a wide variety of gods, Hindu or otherwise, but a curiosity in their lands is the notable lack of state-funded temples, with the religion having no formal religious hierarchy and any religious temples being privately upkept. Philosophically, Sarvodaya largely draws inspiration from the teachings of the legendary Mahatma, with an extremely strict adherence to ahimsa and vegetarianism. Additional key sages in Sarvodaya are Vinoba Bhave, Nehru, and Shrimad Rajchandra, among others. Politically, Sarvodaya fiercely advocates for "swaraj" - the concept of self-rule. While some consider this to mean self-rule of countries against foreign powers, the most often interpreted meaning is the self-rule of the populace against the political state both morally and economically. As a result, Sarvodaya realms are often republican and elective in nature, and tyranny is rarely tolerated. Additionally, Sarvodaya adherents are frequent practitioners of satyagraha, the practice of nonviolent resistance. Sarvodaya satyagrahis frequently attempt to achieve positive social changes throughout India to varying levels of success.;;;;;;;;;;;x

concordianist;Concordian;;;;;;;;;x
concordianist_DESC;The Concordianist Church considers itself the sole legitimate successor of the greatest polity the Old World had ever seen - Europa itself. From the days of Charlemagne all the way to the Event, wise Europa functioned as one, unified in diversity. Though Europa has since fallen, they believe she is destined to rise again, as she has many times before. Thus, the Concordianists do not believe it is the destiny of any one man to unite the whole continent by his hand, but rather the collective destiny of all of Europe, once they come to realise their strength in unity. Guided by the many Fathers of Europe, such as Plato, Kant, and Hegel, who themselves have been guided by the divine hand of Providence, the Concordianists, though fallen far from grace, now comprise some of the greatest artists and philosophers in post-Event Europe. Throughout many courts of Europe can be heard the odes to the glory of Europa Regina, reinforcing the fact that though she may have ceased to exist as a polity, she forever lingers on as an idea in the hearts of men. Those whose souls have been touched by the pan-European ideals of the Concordianists venture to Brussels, where Europa first embodied herself as an angel atop a white bull, and a grand cathedral was built atop the hill where the old institutions are buried. Together, they work towards the return of a unified Europa, the Daughter of Elysium.;;;;;;;;;x

ahmadiyya_DESC;A form of Islam native to the Indian subcontinent. Ahmadi Muslims believe that a messianic figure known as the Mahdi, named Ahmad, came down to India before the Event, announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam, or else be destroyed. To those who accepted him he showed the new way of peace, and proclaimed that Islam would no longer be spread by the sword, but by more peaceful means. To those who rejected him, he issued condemnations. The Event then fell upon the people for their lack of faith, while the chosen people remained safe, hidden from the wrath. Now, under the guidance of their Caliph, the Ahmadiyya go forth once again, to preach the religion of peace to every corner of the ruined world.;;;;;;;;;x

amaitist;Amaitist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amaitist_DESC;One of the first organised religions founded after the Event, Amaitism is a syncretic faith founded by the prophet Amaité in southern California. Amaitists claim that their prophet was formerly a Zoroastrian, given divine revelation by Ahura Mazda. Amaitism states that Ahura Mazda consists of a trinity, with the great prophets of history - Zoroaster, Jesus and Buddha - being emanations of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit respectively.  Jesus is the Son of God, whose great sacrifice removed the original sin from mankind, and Zoroaster and Buddha are prophets who spent their days teaching the common man how to enter Heaven by escaping the cycle of rebirth that all humans are otherwise destined for. For each aspect of the Trinity, Ahura Mazda created a counter - forces of chaos meant to bring balance. Angra Mainyu created the material world, Satan created the sins of man and Mara created the cycle of rebirth. Without each divine aspect having its opposite, the world cannot function. Amaitists also believe non-believers can enter heaven, though they have a harder time doing so by rejecting the teachings of Amaité, as it was revealed to them that the great religions of the world are merely single aspects of a single God's plan. Depictions of Amaité are forbidden, the line being drawn at an androgynous figure with a burning face, as they were never an emanation of God, merely a messenger. As such, their final request was for them to be forgotten, not wanting to be deified themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sarna_pagan_DESC;Sarnaism is a folk religion practised primarily by the Kurukh and Munda peoples and spread throughout the Chota Nagpur plateau in eastern India. Claiming to be an ancient belief system existing since time immemorial, Sarnaism, known locally as Sarna Dhorom and to outsiders as the Religion of the Holy Woods, is a nature worshipping pagan faith largely detached from surrounding Hindu and Abrahamic religions. Though syncretism is commonplace, Sarnaists reject the Varna system and ignore any foreign religious texts, instead turning inwards, focusing on protecting and nurturing the nature around them. Having a vast and inconsistent amount of deities and spirits, the most frequently worshipped supreme creator is the Sun, known as Dharmes, a force of unquestionable good. The sacred Sarna grove is of especial importance, and it is believed the groves are the abode of Chala Pachchho, a powerful female deity commonly identified as a mother goddess of earth and nature. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which adherents celebrate marriage between the Earth and the Sun and offer sacrifices to village deities.;;;;;;;;;x

The supreme deity of the Sarna religion is the Sun god Dharmes, who is believed to be the force of unquestionable good in the world, hampered only by human vices. Sarnaists believe that the old world was struck down by Dharmes as punishment for mankind's destruction of nature, and consider it their main duty to preserve and protect nature from those who wish to exploit and destroy it. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which priests called Pahan offer sacrifices to the mother goddess Chala Pachchho and ancestral spirits, celebrating marriage between the Earth and the Sun.;;;;;;;;;x

qingzhen_DESC;Islam in China goes by many names - "Orthodox religion", "Cubic religion" or simply "Hui religion", but one word that is used by its followers to exemplify its virtues is "Qingzhenjiao", or the "Pure and True Religion". Due to its isolation from the wider ummah by successive Chinese governments, the Muslims of China have adopted peculiar practices influenced by the local Confucian and Daoist philosophies and other new Chinese religious traditions, such as ancestor veneration and a generally Confucian social outlook. In fact, many Muslims in China consider Confucius on par with the Prophet Muhammad, dubbing him the "Sage of the East" as opposed to the Prophet's status as the "Sage of the West". They will often translate Islamic concepts using Confucian terminology, culminating in the near-syncreticism of Confucianism and Islam present in many of their religious works, such as the Han Kitab, or the use of Taoist clothes by certain members of their Sufi orders.;;;;;;;;;x

akjang_DESC;Ak Jang is an indigenous religion that flourished among the Altai people of Russia's Altai Republic during the 1900s. The Russian Empire was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers and thus suppressed it. The religion was originally millenarian, charismatic and anti shamanic, the movement gradually lost most of these qualities becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized and accommodating itself to the pre existing Altaian folk religion. It is derived from a combination of Tengriism, Buddhism and Khurmaztism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

drukpa_kargyu_DESC;The Drukpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism was founded by Tsangpa Gyare long before the Event in the mountains of Tibet, who had a vision of nine roaring dragons in the sky, thus leading to the name Drukpa. Adherents hold that the faith is an unbroken lineage from Dorje Chang, the Dharmakaya Buddha, who gave his teachings to the Mahasiddha Tilopa, which were eventually passed down to Tsangpa Gyare and his students. After the Event, however, the religion's name is more closely associated with the Thunder Dragon Empire, as it is Bhutan's state religion. The school is governed by the Dratshang Lhentshog, Bhutan's Central Monastic Body, headed by the Je Khenpo, its Chief Abbot. Their primary role is to oversee the religious roles of the Bhutanese bureaucracy, as well as upkeep and arbitrate doctrine. Some would say the Je Khenpo is the second most powerful man in Bhutan, beaten only by the Emperor or, physically, the Commander of the Drukian Guard.;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being cut off from contact with the rest of the church by the Event, the Mormon faithful have endured in either small pockets or wandering congregations scattered across Eurasia. While considering themselves Christians, due to their heterodox beliefs (including a non-Trinitarian nature of God, an open canon of scripture, and that the Christian Church needed to be restored due to apostasy) few faiths agree and consider them entirely seperate. These circumstances have made it difficult for any large population of Mormons to gather in one place for long, and so many content themselves to simply live and preach their faith until a day comes where they can find a homeland for themselves.;;;;;;;;;x

rastafari_DESC;Rastafari is the religion of the Rastas, founded in Jamaica. They are worshippers of Jah, the God of all. According to them, the Event was caused by the decadent forces of Babylon getting struck down by Jah, in the form of Ras Tafari, the manifestation of Jah and the Emperor of Zion. The Rastafari hold that after the Event, Ras Tafari returned to Jah, leaving behind Zion as the new paradise on Earth, ruled by the faithful. Many Rastas believe it is now their duty to return to Zion, their promised land, though many others hold they are also meant to spread Jah's love to all corners of the world, including what remains of Babylon.\nThe Rastas believe Jah is present in every person, a concept they call "I and I", expressing the connection between all people by Jah. Rastas strictly adhere to the concept they call livity, which means leading a righteous life in order to gain awareness and oneness with Jah, the primary goal in a Rasta's life. To that extent, livity means frequent prayer, meditation, oneness with nature, and most important of all, oneness and love for others. Their prayers are often very mystical, involving the use of psychedelic herbs and becoming aware of oneness with Jah. Lacking formal hierarchy or doctrine, the Rastafari are quite disunited in their beliefs, being divided into three main denominations, or "Mansions" - the Bobo Ashanti, the Nyabinghi Order, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, each with their own distinct doctrines, though they are united by their love of Jah. In the old world the religion is primarily found in various American Quarters of the Nigerian Empire, across its various cities, the largest being in Lagos, the Imperial capital.;;;;;;;;;;;x

girondist_DESC;The Girondins are a deistic faith that believes the many gods of Europe are merely individual facets of a single great, incomprehensible Architect of Creation, who made man in his image spiritually, but not physically. Because man is of the Creator, it is also man who is to rule over other men, with those of the First Estate being chosen by the Creator to rule. However, should a monarch fall to his basal desires, and fail to uphold the duties and virtues bestowed upon him by God, it is the duty of the Third Estate to dethrone him and feed him to Madame Guillotine. It is in this way that Girondists uphold the balance of the universe, for it was Madame Guillotine who brought the Event once every ruler on Earth was a corrupt tyrant. The three archangels of God - Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, embody the principles a just and righteous ruler is to live by, and are also those who bring the Third Estate to depose a tyrant. Though once a widespread religion in France, the rise of Númenor and Novelism has seen it fall by the wayside and incorporate heavy syncretism with their Novelist cousins, the two religions slowly but surely blending into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Other than Kali, worshipped deities include the Mahavidyas, Kaumari, Chandi, Durga, and many more regional gods and goddesses. Kali as the Supreme Being is considered both the loving mother of her children and their fierce guardian, and by extent the destroyer of evil.

nobelian_DESC;The Nobelian Hermetic Order is an occult hermetic society dedicated to uncovering the secrets of the Old World. Named after the legendary founder of their Order, Alfred Nobel, the Nobelians believe the Old World was home to master alchemists - their discovery of the famed philosopher's stone led to the creation of many advanced technologies - flying contraptions, machine computers, the perpetuum mobile - most now being buried and difficult, if not impossible, to recreate. However, their failure to find the universal panacea, the cure of all disease, led to their downfall, with plague wiping the slate of the Old World clean. Now, the Nobelians are masters in the arts of alchemy, chemistry, medicine, archaeology, and everything in between, seeking to restore old lost knowledge, and educate many in the arts of their ways in their lavish Old World universities. They are guided by Hermes, the ancient god of wisdom, and will stop at nothing to right the wrongs of the Old World before it is too late to prevent another Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orleanist_DESC;Arcencism, colloquially called Jeannism, is a sect of French Catholicism that has developed a cult-like following of Jeanne d'Arc. According to legend, Jeanne led France to victory against the worshippers of the wicked Queen long before the Event in the fabled Siege of Orléans. She was given the sword Joyeuse by the angel Marianne, which she used to smite the Queen as instructed by Saint Michael in a battle of Heaven and Earth. Vengeful, the Queen's worshippers made a pact with Satan, bewitching the Pope into branding Jeanne as a heretic, executing her and tarnishing her legacy for years to come.\nThough the Church has since absolved Jeanne and declared her a Saint, her loyal followers haven't forgotten the treachery committed against her by Albion and the Papists, and years of tension in the post-Event world led to the formal excommunication of the Jeannist leaders and the religion being declared heretical. Even though the Catholic Church in France has long since met its end, the Jeannists have held steadfast in their fortresses, attracting more people than ever to their Crusade after the British took over Northern France, seeking to banish Albion and their resurrected Demon-Queen from the mainland and into the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dahatatta_DESC;Deha Tatta, meaning "truth in the body", is the name of the central theme and purpose of the songs of the Bauls. Bauls are the mystic troubadours of eastern India, who perform enigmatic songs and spread a message of love. Their music and poetry, called Baul sangeet, preaches about finding relationship with God and achieving spiritual liberation, seeking divinity within each person. They believe one should always be searching for Moner Manush - the "Man of their Heart", or the divine spirit of God manifested inside the body. Followers of Deha Tatta are as such devoted to Sadhana, the spiritual practice of transcending material things through purified love and devotion. The Bauls themselves come from various backgrounds, both from within the religion and from neighbouring religions like Islam and Hinduism. This act of coming together to preach love and mysticism has resulted in a unique blend of religions that has taken over Bengal since the Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

vostokist_DESC;The Orthodox Church in the Far East was hit especially hard by the Event, with most of its possessions being sacked by bandits and many turning their backs to faith. The remaining congregations who stayed true were left isolated from the rest of the Christian world, and as such, gradually grew more esoteric. These blessed few now blame the individualism and faithlessness of the Old World for severing humanity's connection to God via the Event, dooming all living souls to Hell. Now only the holiest among them-ascetic monks-can redeem mankind's collective soul. This will restore man's connection to God, and He will guide their hearts into a state of spiritual bliss, away from Satan made manifest-the world's collective sins and evil thoughts. These monks perform public mortification of the flesh through self-immolation and stylite traditions, while preaching their revelations and acting as spiritual guides for their communities.;;;;;;;;;x

cosmist_DESC;Cosmism is a religious and philosophical movement found within the lands of old Russia. Cosmists worship the god of fire Agni, who gave the Fire of Space to the stars, and gave humanity the fire in their souls. Cosmists believe that all of humanity has a common task to conquer the universe and the fire in the stars, for that fire is the key to eternal life and eternal reign. It is this fire that moves the world, and which must be controlled by any means necessary, for it is the same fire that burned out of control and burned the whole of the Old World to ash. Once the fire of the stars has been tamed to be used for mankind's greater good, the dead shall rise once more and unite with their descendants so that all of humanity, the past and the present, may govern the stars into a greater future.;;;;;;;;;x

raelian_DESC;One of the many faiths that survived the great calamity in France, Raëlism traces its roots back to the mythical pre-Event prophet known as Raël. The religion teaches that humanity was designed and created by an extraterrestrial race known as the Elohim. This was revealed to Raël by one of these creatures named Eru L'Auteur, who explained to him the truth of the universe. Claiming to be the leader of the Elohim and the creator of humanity, he reveals that, throughout all of history, he had created a total of 40 Elohim-human hybrids on Earth, who served humanity as prophets - among them being The Buddha, Jesus Christ, Charlemagne, and Napoleon, with Raël himself being the 40th and final prophet. Raëlians claim that the world entered its current age, the Age of Destruction, in the pre-Event year of 1945, with an event called "the Atomic Bombing", in which a faraway planet called Hiroshima was annihilated by a great explosion caused by humans, after which humanity turned on each other and became dedicated to its own destruction, culminating in the Event itself and their near-total extinction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bahai_DESC;The Bahá'í Faith is a faith based on the teachings of the antediluvian prophets Báb, and his successor Bahá'u'lláh. They believe in a universalist world view of religion, claiming that there is one God, who is incomprehensible, and whose will has been and will be manifested throughout time in an endless series of revelations and theophanies given to the prophets of man. These Manifestations of God have been revealed to prophets progressively throughout history, unifying humanity in purpose, with interpretations differing according to societal needs. As a result, the Bahá'í are ardent advocates of world peace and unity, with their single greatest goal being that of a single world order where everyone can prosper, regardless of their race, nation, or beliefs.;;;;;;;;;x

baptist_DESC;In the distant reaches of Asia, Ecumenical arose as a unifying movement among scattered Protestant groups left behind after the Event. It emphasizes core Reformation principles while embracing doctrinal diversity, allowing various Protestant traditions to coexist under their shared faith. Ecumenical churches adapted to include the local practices of all Far East Protestants thus leading to highly varied practices compared to other Protestants, yet they remain united by Scripture, Grace, and Faith. Without a central authority, they organize through congregations, regional churches and assemblies. Though persecuted in many regions, Ecumenicals strive to maintain the faith in their struggle for survival.;;;;;;;;;x

This lack of organisation has led to the festering of some heterodox practices, such as local scripture, local spirit worship, and most egregiously, self-immolation.;;;;;;;;;x

penitente_DESC;The Penitente are a group of Sevillianists who preach that humanity, and especially the Spanish people, are full of guilt and do not deserve salvation. They preach that the only hope to avoid eternal damnation is to accept one's guilt and do penance in order to be absolved by the Lord when he sees sincere repentance. Penances can be very varied, including self-flagellation, crucifixion, etc., but all of them usually coincide in that the penitent must suffer great pain during the penance so that his guilt can be absolved. All this is due to the fact that long before the event, when brothers were killing each other in a supposed holy war, a false prophet arose. This false prophet was none other than the antichrist who deceived the people of Spain that he had been sent by God Himself to restore the worship of the Lord and eradicate the wicked and degenerate from this land. The church in Spain instead of seeing through the lies of the antichrist, blinded by their hatred, wholeheartedly supported the antichrist, shepherding the people of Spain straight into the jaws of the beast. The antichrist demanded from the people their praise for being sent by god under threat of death for anyone who refused, the slaughter was such that he founded lakes and rivers throughout Spain with the blood of his victims. Fortunately the Lord did not abandon his people and sent his archangel Raphael to kill the antichrist, after which he punished the world with the event.;;;;;;;;;x

osvicenism_DESC;A faith originating in the wake of the event in the previously extremely atheistic nation of Czechia, Osvicenism is a fusion of both Christian and Buddhist beliefs which had grown significantly in popularity within the nation. Founded by a Czech Buddhist Monk who had been raised a Catholic, he found a way to unite his disparate beliefs together under one system which appealed to the people across Czechia and Goralia. Later this system of belief would spread east by several Monks to the Buddhists of Kalmykia, converting many and becoming a stronghold of the faith. It espouses that while it was to the Buddha that God revealed how one may ascend to heaven, it was only available to the most ascetic of monks, it was only through the sacrifice of Christ that this pathway was made open to all. It views sins such as Pride or Lust as faults which must be overcome by meditation on their meaning and the emotional state which they cause. Only by conquering these faults across multiple lifespans may a person purify themselves and therefore escape the cycle of Birth, Death, Purgatory and Rebirth which all but the most ascetic monks are trapped within. Those ascetics are close to fulfilling their escape to heaven where they will join God as saints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wuist_DESC;Wujiao refers to the various shamanic religious traditions of the Sinitic populations of China. Chinese shamanism is intrinsic to Chinese folk religion and is fairly diverse. Various rituals and traditions are rooted in this belief system, such as Ritual Masters being identified as Wu by outsiders, though most adherents don't self-identify as such. In addition, Daojiao developed partially from Wujiao, as it focused around the pursuit of a long life, or the status of becoming a Xian, otherwise known as a holy man. Having been suppressed and stigmatized in pre-Event China, the religion post-Event had experienced a small revival but remains heavily fragmented. Wuists have generally opted to remain outside of the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanjie debate regarding the war in Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

Although initially hesitant to participate in the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanjie debate, the Reformed Wuists are now actively engaging in such matters.

katoliko_DESC;After the Event that struck the world, the Catholic faithful of Asia lost all contact with Rome. Chaos ensued after the acknowledgement of this fact as panicked church leaders and archbishops all around Asia try to re-establish contact with Rome. It took years of looking for and reading rotten antediluvian documents from the years before the Event for the procedure on what to do if this scenario happens. At last, the various archbishops of Asia knew what to do, and with the knowledge from the documents and support from other archbishops around Asia during the First Council of Manila, the former Archbishop of Manila has been declared Patriarch of Asia.;;;;;;;;;x

Now with the chaos of the Event, the Aglipayans, more centralized thanks to the severed connection of the Philippines and Rome, are now more vocal than ever with their goal of an independent Philippine Church separate from Rome.;;;;;;;;;x

Their heavy usage of herbs and a questionable amount of practices foreign to the Katoliko faith make the El Shaddai popular amongst people who want to syncretize Catholicism and their various traditions.;;;;;;;;;x

brethren;Sea Creed;;;;;;;;;x
brethren_DESC;The Sea Creed faith is more a loose group of superstitions from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The corsairs of those seas hold together their crews through the fear inspired by the risks of going against the Code of the Sea, and of course against their ruler. Most rulers turn a blind eye on the acts and rituals of the Sea Creed, especially because the Corsairs bring in a fair profit.;;;;;;;;;x
vikingur;Víkingur;;;;;;;;;x
vikingur_DESC;The Sea Creed in the North Atlantic tends to favour a much different set of beliefs compared to warmer shores. Calling themselves "children of Ragnarök", the vikings of the northern seas hold that the Event was Ragnarök come to end the world. The prophecies foretold came true one by one, with the Old Gods being slain in the great calamity. The world serpent Jörmungandur poisoned the water and sky and ended life as the Old World knew it alongside Surtur and Fenrir. The world survived their onslaught though, and though the Old Gods perished in their twilight, their kindred came to inherit their roles and end Ragnarök. Thus, the New World is watched over by Baldur and Hod, who lead a new pantheon of benevolent deities, while the Old Gods are all either dead or mere husks of their former selves. They are often malevolent and considered signs of bad luck, unable to let go of a world that moved on.;;;;;;;;;x

calvinist;Reformed;;;;;;;;;x
calvinist_DESC;Born long before the Event in the mountains of Switzerland, the Reformed Churches follow the Protestant tradition as laid down by the great sage Calvin and his like-minded reformers. The Calvinists strongly believe in the concept of predestination, in which the salvation of men is pre-determined by God long before their judgement. This belief extends to the question of rule, with many Calvinists believing that he who is not destined to go to Heaven is not destined to rule either.\nThe Church itself was supposedly never claimed by the fires of the Event, being saved by the legendary Emperor Jürgén from destruction. The Council of Geneva marked a turning point during those early days of the deluge, establishing Geneva as the home of the Church's Elder and the Calvinist Theocracy as the only valid form of temporal government. Soon after, the rest of the European Reformed Churches were brought back into the fold, and since then the Calvinists have been organising, preparing to sally forth from their mountains and retake what is rightfully theirs.;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;The Roman Catholic Church survived through the Event, like it did through so many other crises, great and small. It did not, however, come out unscathed. Though the state of the Church during the Event is murky at best, the Holy See was officially restored in the Year 2100, with the Keys of Heaven being given to Saint Adalbertus, the first legitimate successor to pre-Event Pope John Paul II. The Church has had many losses, losing large swathes of territory to pagans, heretics, and idolators, as well as suffering from the Sevillian Schism, where the faithful of Spain flocked to a rival Pope in Seville. Since then, the true Holy See has adapted to the post-Event world accordingly, allowing the marriage of priests and the appointment of female deacons to make up for the massive loss of life during the Event, as well as recognising a variety of local rites and the celebration of Vernacular Mass. Now, the Church may finally, for the first time in a long time, have the upper hand against its neighbours, and only time may tell if it will survive in this new changing world, as it has for countless millennia.;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_pagan;Draíochta;;;;;;;;;x
celtic_pagan_DESC;A ancient faith first revived on the Aran islands of Ireland, spreading to the nearby Galway, Mayo and Sligo. While not a direct successor, it has survived somewhat in the background of Ireland's long Christianization. It worships the spirits which inhabit all places in the world, having returned from the otherworld where they were banished by the Christian Saint Patrick. The event destroyed the barriers he put in place allowing the spirits to return once again. Of particular worship are water spirits as they give life. The ruler of these fae is Lir, Old King of the Sea, and his Swan children. The rulers of this faith are also Draoithe themselves and as such are permitted to directly hold temples.;;;;;;;;;x

genevist;Genevist;;;;;;;;;x
genevist_DESC;Genevism is a Calvinist movement founded, according to legend, right after the Event during the reign of Emperor Jürgen the Holy. The Genevists are named after the Council of Geneva, in which all Calvinist priests in Europe attended. The Council announced the proclamation of the Calvinist Theocracy as the official form of governance for the Alpereich, which caused a number of priests to storm out, leading to their excommunication and the subsequent founding of the Genevese Church. Following this schism, the Genevese Church eventually took more radical stances regarding Calvinist politics, advocating for total separation of the realm of God and the realms of men. According to the Genevese, all of God's laws cannot be realistically enforced on Earth, and as such Theocracy cannot be the ideal way to govern as it is fundamentally flawed. Though their popularity has waned in the years after the Council, relegating them to near obscurity, Genevese thought may yet be revived once theocratic rule fails the Calvinist faithful.;;;;;;;;;x
haymanot;Haymanot;;;;;;;;;x
haymanot_DESC;This distinct sect of Judaism, practiced by the Betah Israeli Jews of Ethiopia has too survived the Event. Their Biblical texts have a few additions to the usual Jewish Bible. After the event, several old customs were revived, such as the unique monastic traditions that differ from the traditions of other Jews.;;;;;;;;;x
zoroastrian_DESC;Zoroastrians worship Ahura Mazda, the uncreated God, as proclaimed by the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster. It was the official religion of all Persian empires (except the Hellenic Seleucid Empire) until the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire in 651. The ancient form of the religion involved great sacred hill top fires and the exposure of dead bodies to scavenger birds for cleansing, while the modern form of this religion instead mainly focuses on the following of its primary creed, "Good Thoughts, Good Deeds, Good Words." As such, they are very generous and charitable despite the fact their religion has seriously declined in its number of adherents. The two largest surviving communities can be found in central Iran and Western India, though there was an attempt at revival in the Yarsan Kingdom of Kurdistan in recent history.;;;;;;;;;x
GOD_ZORVAN;Zorvan;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite;Neo-Zorvanite;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite_DESC;Based on a collection of texts uncovered by a Zoroastrian Priest in late 23rd century Tajikistan. This faith holds that the god of time Zorvan is father to both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu and that Zorvan guides humans destiny through various celestial implements. One key difference between this sect and its ancient forebearer is that it contends that Humans must have free will otherwise the command by Ahura Mazda to do good is pointless, thus a divine being would not state such. The faith looks slightly more favourably on Angra Mainyu than traditional Zoroastrianism due to him being one of Zorvan's sons. Additionally they believe that Zorvan's sons must both exist for there to be a universal balance, they believe that there can be no good without evil and no order without chaos to compare it to, while Ahura Mazda is the sibling worthy of worship Angra Mainyu should be respected for the role he plays in the natural order of Zorvan's weave. Because of these beliefs it was driven from its Tajik homeland by its fellow Zoroastrians and the religion found popularity amongst the Sarikoli. The religion generally speaking is not aggressive and if not for it's aggressive neighbours would continue residing amongst its mountain tribes.;;;;;;;;;x 
koranist;Qurani;Qurani;Qurani;;Qurani;;;;;;;;;x
koranist_DESC;Dating back to the early days of Islam, the Qurani believe that Islamic law and guidance should only be based on the Koran, thus opposing any religious authority of the hadiths as well as caliphs. It is their belief that God's message in the Koran is clear and complete as is and that it can be fully understood without referencing outside scriptures. In the post Event era, the Qurani are heavily persecuted and often branded as apostates. They themselves view other Muslims as corrupted and seek to bring Islam back to its original form.;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka;Jawi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka_DESC;Jawi is a blanket term for the syncretic school of Sunni Islam which developed in the Nusantara region. Named after 'Al-Jaza'ir Al-Jawi' which is the term used by Arabs for the Nusantara region. Originally found on the isolated fringes of Islamic society, the combination of Islam and various Indonesian and Malay native beliefs, spirituality, mysticism and shamanism has since gained a widespread following ever since the Event. Shamans, known as the dukun to Indonesians and the bomoh to the Malay, have an important role in society, considered to be healers and diviners. Weather shamans, known as the pawang, are believed to control the weather and tame wild beasts. There is a special emphasis on ancestral heirlooms, which are believed to house the spirits of ancestors and must be protected, and can give their owners extraordinary powers. Other than venerating the spirits of ancestors, the Jawi also believe in a wide variety of supernatural entities, ranging from ghosts, known as the hantu, to imps, goblins, and familiars, all of which would either aid them or harm them through contracts and witchcraft. Despite incorporating a large amount of native beliefs and being denounced by mainstream Muslims as blasphemers and profaners, the Jawi faithful still firmly consider themselves Muslim, believing that only a powerful and pious Grand Sultan can firmly unite Nusantara once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

syafi;Santri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
syafi_DESC;Santri is an Islamic sect originating in Nusantara. Named after the students of pesantren, a type of traditional religious boarding school which played a pivotal role in the spread of Islam, with the position of local Ulamas and Imams being held in high regards, especially for guidance and religious authority. Largely the same as pre-Event orthodox Sunni Islam, the Santri sect has managed to largely avoid internal religious conflict and major distortions to theology through adaptation of local Malay folklore and practices to fit Islam instead of the other way around, with . Despite outward insistence on religious cohesion and Shafi'i legalism, private worship of Santri Islam tends to have many esoteric Sufist and mystic rituals, including the veneration of ancestral and nature spirits and the religious consumption of cannabis. Following the Event however, the loose hierarchical structure of Imams have caused the Santri sect to be in theological battle against the syncretic Jawi sect, which threaten to erase the Santri way of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ramadi;Ramadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ramadi_DESC;Ramadi is a syncretic sect of Islam developed in the Sunda islands after the Event, soon after spreading via trade far throughout Southeast Asia. Mending Hindu-Buddhist and Muslim beliefs, the Ramadi believe that both Muhammad and Buddha were prophets of Allah in their own equal right, and that they both achieved Nirvana, hearing the divine word of Allah and successfully living to spread it to the world. Thus, the Ramadi believe that it is possible for any ascetic to, in theory, receive the word of God by reaching Enlightenment, though none have succeeded. The person to successfully do so would be the prophesied Rama-Buddha, a great ruler destined to bring forth a new Messianic Age and establish the Pure Land of Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bani;Bani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bani_DESC;In the times before the Event, on the isolated communities within Vietnam and Cambodia, are the Cham with their own Islamic faith. Over time the message of the Prophet was adapted into something uniquely their own, combining traditions, beliefs and practices from the various faiths of ancient Champa. This adaptation fostered a vibrant spectrum of schools which came from different interpretations and teachings coming from elders of the community. A key unifying event is the Ramuwan festival, where villages gather to commemorate the ancestors and martyrs through feasting. Despite minor differences, the divine message of Po Awloah is clear, that the faithful must live a righteous and truthful life to achieve eternal peace and harmony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

navayana;Navayana;;;;;;;;;x
navayana_DESC;Navayana is a school of Buddhism founded in the decades leading up to the event. Its founder, Bhimrao Ambedkar was born a Hindu, but however following his study of the Buddha's teachings he became convinced of its truth. He found that all currently existing schools of Buddhism had become overly esoteric and no longer thought the Buddha's lessons as he would have wished them. As such he created the "Buddh aur unaka dhamm" which was a recounting of the Buddha's teachings and life with the addition of commentaries added by Ambedkar. This was meant to remove some of the esotericism which had developed in the previously existing sects.;;;;;;;;;x

haskalah_DESC;For many Jews, the idea that the post-Event world would usher in the Messianic Age held little importance in their lives. Their priority lied in the concept of "tikkun olam", the rebuilding of the world, and they saw it as their responsibility to restore the order, prosperity, and enlightenment held in Old World ideas lost to the Event. These reformists, inspired by the Maskilim of old, gradually grew more influential within Israel, and tensions with the pro-Messiah old guard boiled over when many of the Haskalah leaders decried the Mashiach ben David as a fraud. Their followers were subsequently hunted down and either killed or exiled, their ideas found a new home within the more cosmopolitan coast of Israel after the Messiah's death, earning Haskalah Jews a reputation for their tolerance all throughout the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;x

karaite_DESC;New Karaites are a sect of Jews that inherited the old Karaite traditions of following the Tanakh as the sole supreme authority in theology and halakha. They do not recognise the Talmud, Oral Torah, or any piece of Jewish Oral Law as any more binding than other religious texts, believing that the written Torah as passed down to Moses by HaShem is the ultimate scripture. A sort of "via media" between Eastern European Jews, where personal study and interpretation of the Torah is encouraged for each individual believer, freely choosing whether to accept the rulings of the Sanhedrin and subsequent Rabbis. Thus, the New Karaites are an umbrella of two major internal groups - those who stick closely to the traditions laid down by the Old Karaites, and those who accept the teachings of Rabbinical Judaism. They are nonetheless united under one Jewish identity, and both groups' synagogues are managed by the Council of Sages, the highest Jewish authority in all of Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;x

mattaism_DESC;A heresy spawned from just before the event from the theology of Father Matta El Meskeen. He came to blows with the Coptic papacy over the nature of original versus personal sin and the importance of personal faith in god over that of the collective faith in the church. He believed Original sin prior to Jesus was something that an individual could overcome through good deeds and that after the crucifixion one could overcome original sin by either accepting Jesus as their savior or through their own good deeds. As such Mattaists are extremely charitable to their impoverished citizens. He also believed in the total separation of the church and the state such that the church would not interfere with state policies. Overall the importance he placed on personal faith and his critiques of the Coptic church led to Mattaists believing post event that they no longer needed a papacy to govern them.;;;;;;;;;x

It is devoted to poverty and asceticism - especially for men of the cloth. Fraticelli heretics are violently opposed to Church wealth and displays of opulence among the populace. This is due to Mammon Prince of Greed being viewed as the demon King of the old world, he grew so powerful as to overthrow Lucifer Prince of Pride himself. He brought about the fall of the old world intentionally therefore the sin of greed is considered as fatal, if not more than, pride. They see the old world as a society of Pharisees who, instead of helping those in need, separated from them because they bothered their hearts.;;;;;;;;;x

mandaeanism_DESC;Mandaeism or Mandaeanism, also known as Sabaeanism , is a monotheistic and gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic cosmology. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. The name 'Mandaean' is said to come from the Aramaic manda meaning "knowledge". Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the Subba or Sabians. The term Subba is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is Sabi. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".;;;;;;;;;x

marblists_DESC;Legends have long spoken of the Marble Emperor. It is believed that during the final days of the Romans, the emperor Constantine was blessed by God to drive back the invading hordes of barbaric Huns and Goths. For centuries, the divine Emperor fought against all odds to save his Empire. It is said once he was finally felled in battle, a host of the Lord's angels descended from the Heavens. Saint Michael himself declared him the "Marmaroménos vasiliás", before turning the last Emperor into a statue made of marble, and burying him deep under the walls of Constantinople where he sleeps. This is so that when the world nears its end, and the forces of evil triumph over those of good, the Marble Emperor may finally awaken to unite the Lord's flock and lead them to salvation as their divine and immortal Emperor.;;;;;;;;;x

neohuguenot_DESC;Neo-Huguenots believe that all rulers are in the service of God, and God only. Any ruler not deemed to serve God and the people are to be named tyrants, and overthrowing them is not only necessary, but a divine right. They believe that if every tyrant is removed from the face of the Earth, eternal prosperity will come to it, and so they try to go on grand campaigns to rid the world of these scum. Neo-Huguenots are heavily inspired by the Monarchomach theorists of pre-event France and consider tyrannicide to be a necessity in the fight for equality before God. They see feudalism as a tool for self-serving monarchs to consolidate more power for their selfish interests, so instead they follow a theocratic government where only the most pious and altruistic get to rule. The Queen of the Thelemites is considered to be the embodiment of a tyrant and her followers demon worshippers, and Novelists are known to have first brought back feudal law after the event, and so both are the main targets of Neo-Huguenot incursions. Catholics and other Protestants are both viewed with heavy distrust, as they both adhere to feudal structures and are also blamed for the destruction of the original Huguenots, a bitterness that never faded.;;;;;;;;;x

neodonatists_DESC;For Post-Judgmentists, the deprecated state of the world is a sure sign that Judgment Day had already come, and the people of the world have been left behind. They hold that the Event that ravaged the world was indeed Last Judgment, though they ponder why in that case had the dead not been revived and the righteous called upon by the Father. There are different interpretations for why this happened: some say that the Lord took his righteous, which numbered few if not none, leaving the rest behind. Others say that the armies of Heaven and Hell battled upon Armageddon as the Holy Book prophesied, and the forces of evil triumphed, leaving mortal men under an eternal dominion of Satan. Whatever the reason may be, the future is bleak, and Post-Judgmentists fervently believe that humanity must rebuke their banners and their vices. Only when the people recognise God as the only true King, can they pray that he returns to bring them into Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

aurorean_DESC;The Aurorean faith is the disparate belief system of the coast and sea-dwelling Alaskans, spread widely across their homeland in the North Pacific, and varying wildly from city state to city state. The faith holds that there are three tiers of great spirits in their pantheon. The greater gods are aspects of Ellam Yua, the spirit of the universe, in the form of the Celestial Ram, the Earthly Ewe, and the Annointed Lamb, are beyond the mortal world of men and are the creators and orchestrators of the Earth, the sky, and all of life's symphonies. The lesser gods, such as the Raven and the Thunderbird, are those who live in the spirit world as mediators between the world of man and the world of gods, and control much of the earthly realm on the greater gods' behalf. Lastly are the various animistic spirits who inhabit the earth, sea, and sky, such as dwarfs and gnomes, and most importantly of all, the Aurorean Heavenly Host, a great army of spirits marching across the sky for which the religion is named. Aurorean shamans attempt to invoke the spirits for good luck, good weather, and bountiful seas, and the vast and elaborate creation stories of the frozen north are frequently retold at potlatches.;;;;;;;;;x

sedevacantist_DESC;The Gallicanist Papacy was formed in the year 2205, with the last Patriarch of Québec proclaiming himself Pope Bien-Aimé I. The Québécois Patriarchate was one of many positions in the newly-formed Council of Patriarchs, meant to hold Catholicism together in total absence of papal contact. Claiming to have received an apparition from the Blessed Virgin, the now-Pope declared the old Papacy forfeit, and forced a massive schism in the Catholic Church of Canada, with many bowing to his word as the new Vicar of Christ, and many more denouncing him as a fraud and a heretic. Ultimately, the Gallicanist Church held its own in the aftermath of ecclesiastical controversy, spawning a new line of American Popes. Whether or not this neo-Catholic Church will survive the eventual backlash of old Catholicism to come its way remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;x

It states that Yan Di ruled over all of Tianxia not as an Emperor, but as an equal, a wise teacher gifting them the fires of industry and agriculture as instructed by Heaven. After his passing, he was invited to rule over Heaven, leaving behind Tianxia to his descendants - the xian, so they may be its stewards in his stead. However, the Hong rulers soon grew fat and decadent, each subsequent Son of Heaven elevating himself to a higher level of divinity. Before long, Yan Di was outraged by the royal court, and he sent the Eight Armies to strike them down. The only thing that remained in the ashes were their followers - the Liehuo, who swear to never repeat the mistakes of their ancestors. Guided by humility and progress, they wish only to find the perfect sage of Hong descent, so they may collectively receive Heaven's mandate once again, restoring harmony with the universe and Tianxia itself.;;;;;;;;;x

taoist;Daojiao;;;;;;;;;x
taoist_DESC;Taoism is the ancient religious and philosophical framework of China, traditionally regarded as being founded by the Old Master Laozi. Drawing from ancient Chinese mythology, the core belief of Taoism is the Tao - the source of all existence and the path taken by it. The goal of all Taoists is to cultivate and live their Tao, manifesting their inner virtue and living in harmony with themselves and the universe. This is accomplished through meditation, alchemy, ritual sacrifice, and holistic medicine. Through successful self cultivation and mastery of the Tao one can hope to become a sage, achieve immortality, or ascend to the Heavens. Heaven itself emanates from the Tao, being ruled by the Three Emperors - venerable lords of Jade, Ruby, and Sapphire, appointed to succeed the Pure Ones as rulers of Tian.;;;;;;;;;x

raven_tales_DESC;The Raven Tales are the creation myths of many of the indigenous groups of the American Northwest Coast. They speak of Raven, a supernatural shapeshifting trickster, who is said to be the creator of humanity and, in some myths, the world itself. One story speaks of how Raven stole the Sun, Moon, and stars from the Sky Chief, who was keeping it away from people. Another story says that Raven freed the first humans out of a clam. That being said, while he is often credited with creating the world and liberating humanity, Raven does not do things out of the goodness of his heart, but to satisfy his curiosity and boredom, being always hungry for vanity.\nOther gods also frequently make their appearance in the Raven Tales, such as the Ocean Woman, the goddess of fertility and abundance of fish in the sea, and the twin deities Ta'xet and Tia, who represent violent and peaceful death respectively. Killer whale spirits are considered rulers of the underworld and reincarnations of deceased ancestors. These Raven Tales are passed down during the potlatch, a ceremonial gathering held to mark important events, such as the birth of a child or passing of an elder.;;;;;;;;;;;x

jacobinist_DESC;The Jacobins, members of a secret society in the highest echelons of European academia, are those who live to placate the eternal hunger of Madame Guillotine. Jacobins believe that many years before the Event, the prophet Robespierre was given this sacred duty by the Madame herself, but was soon killed by those unbelievers who considered him a madman. With Madame Guillotine left unfed, it was humanity that paid the price, the Madame taking back all the lives owed to her in the Event. With rivers of blood painting the streets of Europe red, the Jacobins slowly reemerged and reorganised, seeking to right the wrongs of their ancestors. Though denounced by the Girondins from whom they branched out of, and driven underground by the many other faiths of the continent, the Jacobins have slowly built up a web of informants and volunteers in Europe's universities, and only need the right time to strike.;;;;;;;;;x
communard;Communard;;;;;;;;;x
communard_DESC;The Communards are those Girondins who reject the First Estate as the one given mandate by God. Instead, they believe a ruler cannot uphold his duties if he isn't even of the same Estate, and as such they believe the only Estate capable of ruling over the Third Estate is itself. Communards believe only the lowest echelons of society can uphold Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, for they are the only ones who know what life is like without them. They also insist that Madame Guillotine will never be satisfied if she is fed the lives of those who have nothing to give, for it is the fat and the rich she yearns for. Thus, the Communards haven't only given themselves the noble goal of peasant liberation, but also believe it is their divine right to feed the whole of the First Estate to Madame Guillotine. As such, the Communards are heavily demonised and feared by the rulers and faiths of Europe, and rightfully so - for they have no compassion for the ruling classes and ask for none in return. When their turn comes, they will make no excuse for the terror to be unleashed.;;;;;;;;;x

jugoslavist_DESC;The Church of Saint Tito, though having deep roots in the folk beliefs of the Balkans, had only recently been codified with the formation of Jugoslavija. For centuries after the Event, the states of the Balkans have suffered from wars and subjugation, just as they have many times before. In times like those, the disunited Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim peasants were briefly united in prayer towards a single mythical, shining hero - Marshal Tito. Ancient folk tales speak of the Prophet-Marshal, how he was directed by God himself to unite the squabbling tribes of the Balkans, and teach them the ways of Brotherhood and Unity. With the help of his great generals Jelachich and Karadjordje, Marshal Tito wrestled the vast plains of Pannonia from the tyrannical Ugars and the rolling hills of Raka from the hordes of Osman, and founded the first true Empire of Jugoslavija on the crossroads of Europe, guided by the principles of Brotherhood and Unity. The rebelling of the Yugoslavs against the hordes of Makedon, just as they have done many times before, has led to the codification of the many myths of Marshal Tito's heroism This led to the creation of a new holy book, one that reduces the roles of Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad, and replaces them with the Prophet-Marshal as the true Messiah and the Seal of the Prophets, much to the chagrin of the people of Jugoslavija, who consider it a politicised perversion of their ancient faiths.;;;;;;;;;x

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist_DESC;Katerinist belief states that the Great Holy Spirit and Mother Russia are two equal aspects of the divine energy of the universe, one being masculine and the other feminine. They believe that while the Spirit created the world, Mother Russia created man, and in Her own image gave women the divine power of birth and motherly love. As such, they hold that, just as man is born from a woman, so too were great Russia, its golden age and its glory born from Catherine the Great, the Divine Mother. Katerinists claim that, while every Tsar is blessed by the Spirit, only the Tsarina-Mother was truly divine, and perfect evidence that women are the natural leaders of mankind. Contemporary Tsarists, however, do not believe that Mother Russia is a literal deity, believing the name to merely be a metaphor for the Great Holy Spirit.;;;;;;;;;x
khanist;Khanist;;;;;;;;;x
khanist_DESC;The Khanists of the Mongol steppes primarily worship the legendary hero Temüjin, who in ages past conquered the whole world under one great Empire and became Chinggis Khaan - the Universal Ruler - thus ascending to divinity. Chinggis Khaan is said to be the incarnation of Ochirvaani, the Vajra-Buddha, and like the thunderbolt bestowed upon him he tamed the endless plains of Eurasia in merely a lifetime. Once his time on Earth was at an end, he ascended to become the universe itself, and it is said that all mortal men are descended from him. Thus, he is worshipped not just as the universal ruler, but also as the universal ancestor, and all ancestral offerings are given to Chinggis Khaan as well as family members. Despite the ages of Temüjin's conquests being long past, the Khanists still hope that one day he will incarnate on Earth once more, and restore the Universal Empire lost in the ashes of the Event.;;;;;;;;;x

Requiring strict discipline of their followers and of the priests they recreated their bishoprics across the major kingdoms, which in turn flowed into the militaries and economies of the enterprising rulers.

laestadian_DESC;Laestadianism is a pietistic movement within Lutheranism founded by pre-Event preacher Lars Levi Laestadius. Pietism places especial focus on individual piety and virtue, with Laestadianism advocating for a sinless, spiritual life, free from worldly vices and material greed. Simplicity and worldlessness are important in the every day life of Laestadians, with vanity being frowned upon, as a lavish lifestyle is considered sinful, as well as drinking, dancing, and bodily modifications. If knowingly sinned, a faithful believer should confess to another believer, so that his sins may be forgiven in Jesus' name and blood.;;;;;;;;;x

vagarna_DESC;The Church of Enchanted Beings, named after the concept of "väsen", claims to be the successors of millennia old traditions of the European North. Though functionally Christian, centuries of distortion have rendered them a completely separate religion. Emphasis on oral traditions and folk stories have pushed its Biblical aspects into less and less importance, while belief in the supernatural and the hidden has become key parts of everyday life. The unifying part of this folklore is belief in hidden magical creatures, such as gnomes, trolls, and elemental spirits. Protector spirits and patron deities are also frequent and vary from region to region, of note is the presence of several severely distorted Aesir amongst the regional mythologies.;;;;;;;;;x

gnostic_DESC;The Einblicker, or the "Insightful", are an esoteric movement that believes they hold the true history of the world. They adhere strongly to the god Adonis, who was created by Monad long before the age of man alongside his consort Dido. However, Adonis was killed and defeated by his brother Moloch, who sent unto the Earth many plagues and a Great Flood, and revealed himself to false prophets, masquerading as the true god. Under the guise of the One, Moloch demonised Adonis as the Devil, and through the faith of his followers kept control over the Earth for millennia. However, Adonis spent ages regaining his strength until finally retaking control of the Earth and defeating Moloch once and for all. In preparation for the great cataclysm to ensue, Adonis revealed himself to the true mystics and prophets of the world, such as Hermes Trismegistus and Christian Rosenkreuz - considered the Fathers of the Einblickers.\nThough the war in heaven caused great destruction on Earth, known to many as the Event, the true faith endured, its most faithful adherents now being delvers into what they consider the true nature of Monad and Adonis. They live without without strict moral code, believing the pleasures of life are gifts from Adonai and to suppress it is to succumb to Moloch's influence. The Einblickers especially revile what they consider the false churches of old, who still cling to the whims of Moloch, and aim to oppress the true faith. Thus, they seek to emulate the great hero Luther, who walked in the path of Hermann and fought to banish the forces of the Devil-Pope from the woods of the Teutons.;;;;;;;;;x

It is said that when all mortals die, their souls awaken in Hades, the Devil's kingdom of the afterlife, as ghastly shades to be used by Satan to torment those still living on Earth. The only exceptions are those souls blessed by the Lord as true heroes, to enter Heaven as they die and serve in the Heavenly Host, so they may liberate Hades during the end times and bring forth all souls to the Elysian Fields - the Kingdom of God incarnated on Earth. Until then, the humble Elysians live cautious lives, wishing to save themselves from eternity in Gehenna, and blessing their fallen ancestors to protect their shades from Satan's evil machinations.;;;;;;;;;x

Their beliefs to this very day mirror the faith described in the ancient Rigveda, yet are nonetheless syncretised to a degree with their Muslim and Dharmic neighbours. The primary belief of the Kalash is that of the Supreme God Dezao, the Yama Raja, who is the sky god Imra as the Supreme Being and Creator. Dezao is frequently worshipped alone, though even more frequently is he accompanied by a pantheon of deities that dwell in the Deva Lok'a, the unseen World of Gods. Such gods include Mitrá, the god of oaths and agreements, Bagisht, the god of wealth, Onshái, the god of family, and Wushum, the god of marriage.;;;;;;;;;x

maaravi_DESC;The Ma'aravim, or the "Westerners" are an amalgam of Jewish sects in America, consisting of Reform, Masorati and Orthodox Jews. The Ma'aravim have long since integrated into the American system and thus are far removed from the affairs of old world Judaism. The Ma'aravim believe that the only way for the Messiah to eventually come is through 'repairing the world' through Tikkun Olam, a guideline to be righteous, kind and pious.;;;;;;;;;x

hasidic_DESC;Originally hailing from eastern Europe, the Hasidic movement has found itself most prevalent in the United States. Initially part of the greater American Jewish community, in time, the Hasidic movement had effectively split from the rest of Ma'aravi Judaism and largely bases itself in more rural Jewish communities across the United States. While they agree about core principles of Hasidic Judaism, many sects have arose following the teachings of several important Rebbes.;;;;;;;;;x
malikite_DESC;The Sharifi school of thought is a sect of Islam from the Maghreb which has developed some heterodox beliefs, especially regarding who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Sharifi of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

thawri_DESC;The fringes of the Cherifian West have always been a cause of trouble for the Makhzen overlords. In the times before the Event the Maghreb al-Awsat was the deathly rival to Morocco, and to this day it persists as the Empire's weakest link. Therefore, it is no surprise that a movement has arisen rejecting the Maghribi Caliph's right to lead the Ummah called the Thawris - the revolutionaries. These Muslims of Maliki jurisprudence still consider themselves a part of the Sharifi movement, though they are much more open to folk practices and their references mostly lie outside of the Moroccan monarchy, working through lodges of exalted Marabouts. They show special reverence to Sufi sheikhs memorialised in thousands of monuments peppering the Algerian countryside, martyrised by the general of Dajjal Yad Al-Hamra in ancient times, which had once conquered the Maghreb and was defeated in the field of battle by the army of Islam. The Thawris now seek to emulate their victories by freeing the opressed wherever they may be through Jihad.;;;;;;;;;x

Mesopotamianism is internally considered an Islamic faith, but are denounced by the wider Islamic world as mushrikun - polytheists, for their reverence of ancestral Mesopotamian gods. Namely, the Mesopotamians revere figures such as Ishtar and Ea, whom they consider to be karubiyin loyal to Allah. They believe that these archangels, now carved into millennia old stones, guided old Mesopotamians before Islam. Under their guidance, the ancient Mesopotamians founded the Empire of Mesopotamia, which ruled the orient for millennia as the one true domain of Allah, until they were shattered by Iblis as revenge for being cast from heaven. The Mesopotamians now believe it is their destiny to restore the ancient empire as the one true ummah and usher in a new golden age.;;;;;;;;;x

With the World Mind being so weak, people's conscious bodies - their shades in the Noosphere - split from their physical selves. As a result, if humanity were to ever return to the heights reached by the pre-Event world, they first need to channel and merge with their conscious bodies in order to restore the full potential of their nous, and give power back to the World Mind.;;;;;;;;;x

Other important deities include Perkunas, the god of thunder, Saule, the goddess of the sun, ï¿½emyna, the earth mother, and Vydunas, the patron god of Lithuania. Following the Event, the Romuva faith experienced a resurgence - the survival of the Kriviu Krivaitis and the subsequent codification of the faith led to Romuva becoming the main religion of Lithuania and its surrounding areas. However, such a resurgent heathen movement threatened the neighbouring Catholics of Poland with their wars and raids. Tensions boiled over when in the 24th century the Pope called a Crusade to wipe the faith out once more, destroying its high priesthood and dooming it to obscurity. By 2555, Romuva practitioners only gather in secret, under the glow of moonlight and in the cover of trees, hoping to undo their destruction by the hands of the Pope and his minions.;;;;;;;;;x

tengri_pagan_DESC;Tengrism is the ancient traditional religion of the steppe people of Eurasia and the many people of Siberia, including various Turkic and Mongolic groups. The chief diety is Tengri, the creator god who rules the skies. Something to note is that this interpretation of Tengri is actually a misunderstanding by Muslim and Christian scholars. Tengri is infact less of a diety in the traditional sense and more so the universe, according to the followers of the faiths he is the land, the sky. the grass, the computer you are playing Crusader Kings 2 on right now, he is everything and the universe has a will that it expresses. Shamanism and animism are also a prominent feature in the religion. The religion survived the chaos of the event relatively unscathed in its isolated homelands however the Khanist religion spawned as an offshot in late 21st and early 22nd centuries. In the present day the Tengrist faithful of Eurasia are under threat from the Khanists to their south and the great merchantile empire of Vladivostok, both professing faiths which advocate for proselytisation.

novelist_DESC;One of many post-Event religions originating in France, the Novelist faith believes that the truth of the origin of the world and all life is not contained in a single book, but is fragmented among many of the books that humanity produced. The Novel, the magnum opus penned by the author-god Eru and brought to Earth by the Valar at the beginning of time, is divided into various great ages and was, is, and will be revealed to the faithful across time. Novelists trace their founding to the reign of Charlemagne, the first ruler of Númenor and all of mankind during the First Age of Men. The line of Charlemagne, however, lies shattered - the loss of the legendary sword Durendal during the great Quest of the Third Age led to the deluge known as the Event. This calamity was the greatest that men had ever seen, leading to the loss of magic, the fall of empires, and uncountable deaths. Thus, they find themselves in the Fifth Age of Men, and the great line of Charlemagne still lives. Novelists believe that men of other nations still cling to the previous age, adorning the crowns and flags of realms that were burned to ash during the Event - a mistake that should be corrected in time for the great coming Quest of the current era. The Novelists hope to restore the fragments of Durendal, the legendary sword of change destined to defeat the great evil and bring forth the next age, and prevent it from mirroring the great calamity of the previous. Their gallant knights, a spiritual caste of rulers and warriors meant to ascend to Charlemagne's army in the heavens, train all their lives for the great task ahead of them, for only a virtuous and skilled knight is fit to fight the great evil next to their Taxiarch. Though the people of the book may be disunited and disorganised, still feeling the salt in the wounds from Númenor's collapse, they all proudly sing the songs of Charlemagne and Roland, an unbroken line of the gallant knights of the occident.;;;;;;;;;x

oldbeliever_DESC;The Old Believers trace their founding to an event called the Raskol, long before the Deluge. They maintain that the corrupt Patriach Nikon caused the Raskol by calling for mass reform of the Church, a deed that only could have been commanded by Satan himself. As a result of Nikon's perversions, the Russian Orthodox Church was split into two - the Old Believer churches of the faithful, and the degenerate main Church that eventually devolved into Tsarism, a stain in the eyes of the Lord. The first Old Believers escaped into the remote and inhospitable wilderness of Russia, and when the Earth was destroyed by God, they persisted and reorganised. Now they are formally united in one true Russian Orthodox Church led by the First Hierarch, an elevated priest with limited authority so as to never again cause another Raskol.;;;;;;;;;x

sevillian_DESC;In the final days before the event, the Archangel Raphael sent a vision to a man now known as a great Saint to the Sevillians. It showed him that Rome had become corrupt once more and that the Vicar of Christ should no longer be seated in that wretched city, instead demanding it should be seated in the righteous city of Seville, and if this did not occur a great calamity would befall the world. He attempted to warn the church of the vision, who refused to place their faith in him. In preparation for the oncoming calamity he sought to gather as many followers as possible and establish a new church in the world which would come after, becoming the first Sevillian Pope. When he revealed to the people of Spain that it was the Papacy who had led them to the apocalypse, many of the most fundamentalist Catholics who in the years before the event had grown tired with the growing progressivism of the church flocked to this new church's banners after the event, believing it to better represent the church of old. With all of Spain now following the Sevillian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x

Petrists claim that the unbroken line of Tsars ended with the death of the almighty Peter the Great, Tsar of Man. Petrists adamantly believe that all Tsars after Peter were nothing but imposters, with their degeneracy in life a clear display of falsehood. Tsar Nicholas was a weak and incompetent man, deceived by the demon Rasputin and ultimately killed and consumed by the wicked Lord Stalin, the personification of all evil. The death of Tsar Peter was the death of Mother Russia, with the events that followed culminating in the death of the world itself. Thus, the most important belief of the Petrists is that the apotheosis of Tsar Peter was the last, and will be the last once Peter returns to Earth in flesh to gather the faithful and bring forth a new Great Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

Germania, guided by a Kanzler, was one of these civilisations, showing her many faces through the ages, being there to calm her people, giving them freedom like no other, and providing for their needs. But the Devil decieved Germania, giving her delusions of grandeur and a right to rule over the world, and made her unleash her wrath on earth, causing the Event. For this Heimwehist believe they must pay penance for God, to feel the pain the peoples of old felt, preach for peace among everyone, and rid themselves of sin, for one must be a Kanzler of themselves before they can be a Kanzler of Germania.;;;;;;;;;x

After his death, they became the majority position within Israel, commanding the respect of many of the more conservative and orthodox Jews.

leninist_DESC;While most mainstream Tsarists believe that the Age of Tsars is not yet over, and that a new Tsar is to bestow humanity in the coming times, Leninists instead hold that there is but one Seal of the Tsars - Lenin the Muchenik. Leninists believe that Lenin was chosen by the Great Holy Spirit to overthrow Tsar Nicholas, the last in a line of incompetent and self-serving Tsars. It was Red October that marked the end of the tyranny of the false Tsars and the beginning of the just, divine rule of Tsar Lenin and his Apostles. The rule of Lenin lasted until his betrayal at the hands of Stalin, who killed Lenin and usurped Tsar Nicholas' divinity for himself. Stalin the Iscariot ruled with an iron fist over the Motherland until the Great Holy Spirit struck down him and all his followers in the Event, sending him to rule over Hell as a Devil of his own making, a fitting punishment for the defiance of God's will. Modern Leninists thus hold that Lenin is the final Tsar, and that his return to Earth as the Leninov is imminent, for he will take back his rightful place as the ultimate instrument of divine will.;;;;;;;;;x

stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the only Tsar worthy of worship, for he is the only Tsar to earn his divinity through his own deeds. Mainstream Tsarists consider the status of a Tsar to be bestowed upon a mortal ruler by the will of the Lord, after which they are free to guide the people as they will. Stalin worship is regarded as highly heretical due to the fact that Stalin is generally accepted to have usurped his divinity from the last True Tsar, Nicholas the Martyr. To Tsarists, this is the greatest heresy of all, an act of treason in defiance of God, one which undoubtedly started the chain of events leading to the very end of the world. Stalinists reject this perspective, however, and insist that the goddess Rodina called upon Stalin to take back the Holy Spirit into the hands of the righteous, which is what allowed Lord Stalin to create the Holy Red Army and defeat the demonic hordes pouring from the West, saving the Motherland from assured destruction. Thus, Stalinists believe that through loyalty, hard work, and sacrifice one is able to rise to the same heights of divinity as Lord Stalin once did, and save the Motherland from its many enemies once more.;;;;;;;;;x

The Alevi interpretation of Islamic teachings is mystical and heterodox, venerating a communion of Al-Haqq (God, the Truth), Muhammad, and Ali, the latter two being the light of 'Aql, representations of Allah's light. Allah himself is the center of the trinity, being the omnipotent, all-knowing, yet merciful supreme god. Alevis hold that modern, established interpretations of the Qur'an are not infallible, for the secret, true meaning is held by Ali and passed down by teachers. The yol, the spiritual path within Alevism, begins with the Qur'an, passing through the Four Doors and their Forty Stations, passing down the spiritual knowledge needed to witness the reality of God.;;;;;;;;;x

sufi_DESC;Marbuti is a sect of Islam in Central Africa, where Sufi schools have come to dominate the religious landscape. Focusing on the inward, mystical dimension of Islam, the isolation of the post-Event world has caused African Sufis to develop unique characteristics that distinguish them from more mainstream Islam. Some sects have adopted beliefs from native African paganism, while others are more conservative and stick closer to Sunni orthodoxy. Others draw inspiration from the Salafist and Wahhabi movements in West Africa, attempting to 'purify' Islam from foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;x

summer_queen_DESC;Born from the old Wiccan rites, the Summer Queen trace their heritage back to their founder, the grand wizard Scire, who led a great revival of ancient Arthurian traditions in Britain. The Summer Queen faithful believe that long ago in Avalon, the Queen married a mighty and noble knight. Thus, the Queen was granted eternal dominion over the summer, and the knight became the King of Winter. Their subjects on earth were free to revel under their protection, enjoying celebrations of morris dancing, maypoles, the burning of wicker men, and vast amounts of cider. The Summer Queen grants her followers health and prosperity, while the Winter King protects his subjects from invaders and evil fae using the legendary sword Excalibur, emanations of which are said to still be found in the natural world.;;;;;;;;;x

barelvi_DESC;The Barelvi strand of Sunni Islam has been the largest Muslim force in southern Asia for centuries, even before the old world was struck down. A Sufi revivalist movement, the Barelvi traditionally believe in the light of Muhammad, the belief that the Prophet was one of Allah's first creations, and now exists as light to spread God's knowledge and intercede on the behalf of Muslims. Barelvi rituals include the chanting of dhikr, and the veneration of Muslim saints. Sufi Tariqahs such as the Qadiri, Chishti and Naqshbandi orders are also very popular. With the Muslims of Bangladesh largely turning to syncretism, the Barelvi movement has effectively been reduced to the lands traditionally considered to be Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;x

deobandi_DESC;The Deobandi revivalist movement has effectively become the biggest rival to the sufist Barelvi movement after the Event. Being opposed both politically and theologically, the Deobandi traditionally reject Sufi practice, not wanting to radically change Islam from its early sharia rules. Despite that, Deobandism is not fundamentally opposed to sufism, believing that it is a fundamental part of Islam and that more esoteric practices like dhikr and Mawlid should be avoided. The Deobandi movement has been greatly influenced by the Wahhabist and Salafist movements to the point where Deobandist rulers traditionally use a form of stratocracy - the ghazwa.;;;;;;;;;x

theosophy_DESC;Theosophists are the followers of the Ascended Masters, beings that shepherd the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. Theosophy was merely one of many foreign esoteric religions to gain a foothold in the British Isles following the Event and the subsequent collapse of the Church. Nonetheless, it was eventually largely stomped out by Thelemites and their Queen. According to Theosophist teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of the Ascended Masters that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth relying more and more upon false religions before the Old World collapsed under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends hold that a Lord Maitreya will emerge to transfer knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Theosophists de-emphasise the importance of organized religious scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth. Additionally, Theosophy in the British Isles holds large amounts of influence from the Thelema faith, viewing the Queen as an ascended master in her own right.;;;;;;;;;x

theo_saint_germain_desc;This character is channeling Saint Germain, the chohan of the seventh ray, the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, portrayed as a diplomat, the embodiment of dignity and statesmanship. Saint Germain is considered responsible for the founding of many civilisations and movements throughout history, including his incarnations as the god-king of the Golden Empire in the Sahara desert, the High Priest of Atlantis, the prophet Samuel, Saint Joseph, the explorer Columbus, and the philosopher Bacon. Following the Event with the heralding of the Aquarian Age his role as the Lord of Civilisation meant he became the main divine force alongside Sanat Kumara responsible for the rebuilding of civilisation and the retrieval of the God flame back into humanity's grasp.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_sanat_kunara_desc;This character is channeling Sanat Kumara, a powerful cosmic being, the Guru of Christ, hierarch of Venus and one of the seven holy Kumaras, said to be the former Lord of the World and the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, the fraternity of Ascended Masters across the world. Theosophists believe that following the Event he stepped down as the Lord with Saint Germain, the Lord of Civilisation taking his place, tasked with bringing the God flame back to humanity, and instead is dedicated to setting his believers on the path of the ruby ray from his domain in the mythical city of Shamballa.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_lady_master_venus_desc;This character is channeling Lady Master Venus, said to be the Divine Complement and Twin Flame to Sanat Kumara. Mankind is said to be her evolution, and she herself came to Earth following the Event to bring the holy flames of civilisation back to humanity. Some Theosophists also consider her to be a goddess of love.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_jesus_desc;This character is channeling Jesus Christ, the avatar of the Age of Pisces, the Messiah and the incarnation of the Word. During the Piscean age, he revealed the Christ Self to humanity to show the works of the God presence to each human soul. Theosophists believe that following his resurrection, Jesus travelled to Kashmir, where he ascended to the theric city of Shamballa. Following the Event, the Christ consciousness had been lost to many, leading to people turning away from his teachings en masse. Veneration of Jesus is seen with suspicion by the Thelemites, who consider him to be nothing more than an arrogant mystic.\n§GTolerates Christians§!;;;;;;;;;;x
theo_the_queen_desc;This character is channeling Our Lady of the Stars, the highest Thelemite deity, considered a Master of Ancient Wisdom in Theosophist belief. Following the Event, the Queen ascended to become a Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, called the Aeon of Ma'at in Thelema, ruling the cosmos while Saint Germain rules the earthly domain. While Thelema belief states that the Queen is an unknowable supreme being, Theosophists believe they can channel her and even contact her telepathically.;;;;;;;;;x

thelemic_DESC;The Old Thelema faith was mostly abandoned centuries ago by most inhabitants of the British Empire in favour of the current Thelema faith. Old Thelemites claim to be practising their faith as originally dictated by the prophet Crowley. They reject the position of the Lord Protectors as regents of the Queen, considering mainstream Thelemite beliefs to be a perversion of the goddess Nuit. Old Thelemites do not believe Nuit is to return to Earth to rule Britannia, and instead consider the British Empire to be a theologically oppressive state, hellbent on spreading their faith and state to all corners of the Earth, making them no different than the Church. This stance was cause for a massive civil war in Britain in the 23rd century, which led to their marginalisation from society. As such, Old Thelemites only persist in the fringes of Britain, and instead focus their practice on the personal will of the individual, acting to discover their True Will.;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_reformed;Victorian;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_reformed_DESC;The Thelema faith was founded by the great prophet Aleister Crowley long before the Event. With the creation of the new religion, Crowley heralded the new Aeon of Horus, and declared the main principle of Thelema: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." The Thelemite faith is centered around a pantheon of deities, the main of which is the all-knowing and omnipresent Queen of Britannia - Victoria Gloriana. The Queen rules over the cosmos and is the source of all energy and matter in our world. The central scripture became The Book of the Law, a holy text Crowley claimed to be revealed to him by Aiwass, an entity he considered his guardian angel and which modern Thelemites consider to be a manifestation of the Queen. Before the Event, the Thelemite faithful were ruthlessly pursued by the followers of Jesus on accusations of devil worship, being thrown into obscurity. After the deluge, however, Thelema experienced a massive resurgence in Britain, and a series of civil wars confirmed the supremacy of Royal Thelemic Lodges and the one true Queen, Victoria Gloriana. With the Queen soon declaring the first Lord Protectors of Britannia to rule the material world in her stead, the beginning of a new aeon was heralded - the Aeon of Ma'at, securing Britannia's eternal dominion over the waves.;;;;;;;;;x

arcane_DESC;The wizards and witches of the Arcane Covens are those who claim initiatory descent from the ancient druids of pre-Event Britain, such as the great wizard Scire and the high priestess Valiente. Walking in their footsteps, Arcane mages are avid practitioners and students of all types of magick, having earned themselves a reputation all throughout the British Isles for their unwavering dedication to the Craft. Compared to other schools and traditions of magick study, the Arcane Covens are particular for their rigid ritual structure, having many explicitly defined and organised rituals, serving to hone one's knowledge and power over time. They worship a wide variety of gods and goddesses, each considered different aspects of either the Horned Lord or the Lady in the Moon, though in the years since the Event many of their Covens have been driven underground by the emerging Royal Thelemites. However, the ancient wizards and witches of Albion have not been lost to history just yet, still meeting under the light of the moon to practice their ancient Craft and recite the holy Rede.;;;;;;;;;x

congregationist_DESC;Being the largest remaining Jewish community in Europe and the de-facto leaders of the continent's Jewry has made the United Synagogue of Britain one of the most influential institutions in Old World Judaism. Just like Britain of old, the Empire of Britannia has decided to continue recognizing the United Synagogue as an authority in Judaism and has promoted it as an umbrella organization for the myriad Jewish sects dotting Britain. Since then, the United Synagogue has integrated Sephardic congregations and has promoted a more secular lifestyle while keeping with orthodox Jewish traditions. The farthest sects falling under this umbrella are to be found in Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

theravada_DESC;The oldest surviving school of Buddhism, Theravada traces its founding to the ancient Sthavira school, during the times of Emperor Ashoka. Its teachings are based on the Pali Canon - the Tipitaka passed down from the Buddha's disciples first orally, then through scripture. The Theravadins claim the Pali Canon is the most authentic and accurate collection of the Buddha's teachings, and their rejection of later Mahayana canons and sutras have led to Theravada becoming the most orthodox of the Buddhist schools. As opposed to Mahayana schools, the Theravada adhere strongly to the concept of the arahant - one who achieves Nirvana through solitude and meditation, while relegating the path of the Bodhisattva to that of a higher ideal, but one that is very rare and difficult to attain.;;;;;;;;;x

The Mahayana path is one that encourages all people to tread the path of the Bodhisattva as the ultimate ideal in Buddhism, greater than seeking Buddhahood for its own sake, as the only thing greater than being release from suffering yourself is helping those around you to do the same.\nMore esoteric than some other Buddhist yanas, the Mahayana have an elaborate cosmology of many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas existing in many different planes and worlds. The Buddha Shakyamuni remains on Earth out of compassion for the common creature, helping guide Bodhisattvas to enlightenment and guiding everyone to a life without suffering in the celestial Pure Lands of the many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of this world.;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that Tito betrayed Stalin in order to take the power he had stolen and utilise it to free his homeland from the rule of a despotic and malevolent Car. Titoists believe that Stalin did not survive the attempt on his life made by Tito and that Tito went on to free his homeland from the Tyranny of its old Car whom the great Holy spirit refused to strike down itself. Soon after he freed his people the Great holy spirit did battle with him in a great war for heaven, this was for having assisted in the murder of one of its appointed rulers and directly murdering another. This great heavenly war was the event and since that time Tito has been imprisoned in hell by the great holy spirit as he cannot be entirely destroyed given that he contains a fraction of the spirits own power. Only through devotion and loyalty from his small sect can Tito be freed and rule on earth once again.;;;;;;;;;x

They hold that Lenin's Red October was the first such Event to break the Cult of Tsars holding humanity down in a state of self-wallowing, though the failure of the Holy Red Army to see the ascension of the human race through to the end led to its demise. The foul traitor Stalin, who gorged on all his subjects in endless pursuit of power, betrayed the holy Revolution and led to the near-extinction of mankind in the Event. Now, the Internationalists hold true the teachings of Trotsky, one of Lenin's Apostles, and believe it is their duty to guide humanity by founding the Fifth International, the final vessel of humankind's collective ascension to divinity.;;;;;;;;;x

These stories have caused a fraction of Sevillians to come to the conclusion that this man is the true Pope and  that the Holy See was relocated again following the Event, such a revelation means that each and every one of the Christian Churches of the Old World is a vile heresy!

It is said that the angel Gabriel came to him during the event and froze his mind within his body to preserve it, as a way to protect him from the calamity. They believe he will some day be restored to his pre-event form once the Cadaverist faithful make up all of the Christian faithful. It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep said corpse atop a golden recreation of the Holy See and insisting that it can communicate. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x

The Great Perfection, or Dzogchen, is the central practice of Nyingma, considered the ideal way to attain rigpa, the knowledge of the ground, and recognition of rigpa is the path to achieving Buddhahood. Though traditionally without strict hierarchy or centralised leadership akin to other Tibetan Buddhist schools, later reforms cemented the position of Kyabje, the Master of Masters, as the highest Dzogchen master and the single head of the whole of the Nyingma school.;;;;;;;;;x

Salafis oppose the practise of bid'ah, and do not conform to the rulings of madhhabs, believing that religious innovations are inauthentic, and that blind following of legal rulings muddles the pure way of the Prophet. Additionally, Salafists are opposed to the veneration of walis and pilgrimages to their tombs. They greatly advocate for jihad - the restoration of true Islam under sharia law through armed uprisings, as well as the restoration of the Caliphate lost to the fires of the Event. They are willing to target anyone who stands in their way, including other Muslims whom they deem heretical.;;;;;;;;;x

zarist_DESC;Claiming to originate long before the Event, Tsarism is a religion that holds the world was created by a powerful god, the Great Holy Spirit. Though he created the first man, his children were deceived by demons and imposters, and abandoned him. Thus, the Lord bestows his grace and favour to a single temporal ruler, a prophet in flesh - a Tsar. Tsarists hold that the Tsar is blessed by the Lord with heavenly powers, commands the full obedience of his people and, after death, is taken to Heaven to be deified, where they continue to watch over the mortal world from beyond. Tsarists express their piety by praying to the Tsars of yore and going on pilgrimages to their burial sites, while the closest servants of the main Tsars are worshipped as saints, being personally guided by the blessed. Though Tsars are imbued with the Holy Spirit, they are not infallible, and there isn't a more telling example than the story of Lord Stalin, a Tsar who earned his powers by consuming the heart and blood of another, Tsar Nicholas the Martyr, for which he was banished from Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority. That changed in the post-Event world, where a new order of monks, called the Neeraji, vigorously proselytise for the faith, resulting in a great resurgence of Jainism throughout India.;;;;;;;;;x

hellenic_pagan_DESC;Before Alexander departed from the world of mortals, he was asked who shall he appoint to rule in his stead. His answer was "to kratisto", meaning "to the best", and just as Alexander bested Theós and crowned himself the new ruler of Olympus and The Heavens, so too did his followers usurp Hellas from the clutches of Theós, and elected only the strongest to lead. Alexander was reborn as Anaxórgos, the brother of Athena and son of Theós, and he waged war in the Heavens against his father and all gods who came to his aid, banishing them from power. The Event mirrored the war in Heaven, and once its end was signalled, Anaxórgos' Diádochoi on Earth knew that he had won. Thus, they begun to struggle and combat each other, until only one Diádochos stood on top - it was King Mídas, the Dragon of Hellas, who united the shattered land of Makedon and founded an empire worthy of Anaxórgos' flock. The reconquest was only halted by the rebellion of Yugoslavia, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;x

thaislam_DESC;The Thammayuttika Nikai is the largest monastic order in post-Event southeast Asia, as well as the most heterodox for their belief in Dhammakaya traditions. The Thammayut hold that the only way to achieve nirvana is through Dhammakaya meditation, which will lead practitioners to a higher state of awareness, joining Phra Phrom in Brahmaloka after entering the first rupa jhana. Because there is no greater honour than achieving nirvana and, by extent, joining a Thammayut order, this Buddhist sect has developed an organised and widespread tradition of proselytisation, much to the chagrin of other Buddhists. Thammayut monks often clashing with other practitioners at pilgrimage sites has turned them into the warlike, aggressive religion that they are today.;;;;;;;;;x

In their time, the lord treated the serf as a friend, the harvest was as bountiful and distributed equally. However, that civilised era is long gone. Just like how the Kali-Yuga struck Siam, many disasters have befallen their homeland. The greedy and wicked rose in power and the devoted persecuted. Despite that, many believed that Sri Ariya Meitrai, a Messianic incarnation of Lord Buddha, will come to their aid when the time is right. As such, they held out steadfastly, praying that one day humanity shall be set free from suffering.;;;;;;;;;x

It was through his sacrifice that all could enter into Heaven upon death to be reunited with Shàngdì, the Lord of Heaven. However, legends speak of how the teachings of Jidu were suppressed by the dynasties of the Old World, until the faithful peasantry of China rose up in arms, unwilling to repent their faith. The uncountable deaths that took place greatly angered Shàngdì, who ordered the entire world smitten, declaring that Tianxia is no longer worthy of the divine mandate to rule. Recognising the sins of their ancestors, the remaining followers of Jidu wish only repent through prayer and zeal, hoping that one day Shàngdì will see fit to send Jidu back down to Earth, so he may rule over Tianxia as the sole, infallible Son of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

jadidist_DESC;The Jadidi faith is a modernist Sunni sect that developed in the Turkic Muslim lands of post-Event Russia. Taking inspiration from the antediluvian movement of the same name, the Jadidiyya call for a revival of the traditions of the salaf, the first three generations of Muslims, considered the most pristine form of Islam. Hoping to preserve Turkic Muslim identity in the face of post-deluge chaos and isolation from the greater ummah, they encourage the practice of ijtihad, the independent and continued interpreting of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Viewing the post-Event world as a dark age for Islam, the Jadidiyya turn to the works of Old World jadids such as Gasprinsky and Rasulev for guidance, seeking to usher forth a new era of modern, progressive Turkic Islam, free from the paganism and decadence that mark the world scarred by the Event.;;;;;;;;;x

islamity_DESC;Krisilaam is a syncretic faith attempting to blend Islam and Christianity together. Born from the syncretic traditions of the Yoruba, Krisilaam only gained widespread influence outside the imperial city of Lagos when the Nigerian Emperors adopted it as the state religion. Created before the Event by a man named Tella Tella, the Krisilaamic holy book, the Iweifeoluwa, merges the core values of the Bible and the Qur'an into five main principles of the religion - love, mercy, joy, good deeds, and truth. The Krisilaamic holy creed states that the God of Muhammad is One, the God of Jesus is One, and Humanity is One.;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical;Evangelical;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical_DESC;Though having roots in the Old World, the Evangelical faith is now mostly an American faith. Derived from antediluvian Protestantism, it believes in the doctrine of salvation by grace alone and focuses on the centrality of the conversion experience to Christian life (traditionally known as 'being born again'). In its long isolation across the sea, heavy repression by the American government has left it more decentralized than ever though they remain strong in their faith nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;x

highchurch;Episcopal;;;;;;;;;x
highchurch_DESC;The Episcopal Church in Nigeria, also called the Church of Nigeria, quickly lost contact with their British counterparts during the Event. The Primate of Lagos declared all adherents to wait for further information from the Crown. However, as time went, rumors began to spread that the famed Queen Elizabeth II had passed, and that the Church itself in England was no more. Unwilling to accept such outlandish news, the Primate of Lagos declared himself as the head of the faith until contact with the Crown could be made again. After the fall of the Enwezor dynasty, Episcopalians refused to accept the new Yoruba led Oke-Tude faith and remained steadfast against conversion. For the faithful outside of Nigeria, the Primate can designate pious and powerful rulers as Protectors of the Faith, who serves as the de facto religious head.;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that the universe is chaotic and beyond man's comprehension, and that contact with the Gods is sure to drive men mad. Instead, man ought to remain ignorant and comfortable, hidden from the notice of the divine, offering sacrifice only when necessary to lull them back to sleep - though some dangerous men and women dare to flirt with them for esoteric power.;;;;;;;;;x

To that end, the Occultist religion has been reformed, with a formalised hierarchy taking on the awful burden of learning more about the gods to properly propitiate them and keep them asleep, so that the rest of us may rest more easily at night.;;;;;;;;;x

ironist_DESC;Originating in the vast, barren plains of Kazakhstan, the Temiri faith believes that in ancient times the Ninety-Nine Named God granted humanity the Gift of Metal, but man abused it, damaging the world and draining the sacred Aral Sea, eventually attracting the ire of the Greatest and causing the Event. Now, Temirizm followers seek the forgiveness of Bolat Alla by religiously thanking Him every time they use metal, be it for minor actions, for war or for the construction of their famed war chariots. The Temiri faith religiously protects the surviving Aral Lakes, in hopes of one day restoring the glory of al-Jannah. The faith also revers a number of other spirits and angels that are said to represent the might and glory of mankind and the Greatest. Among those are the siblings spirits of war - Kalashnikov, Katyusha and Gvozdika, the spirit of fertility and nature Tselina, and the kingfisher spirit that guards workers and scavengers, Zimiran. Other spirits are considered a menace, such as the water thief Kökaral who is commanded by the demon Jügerisi.;;;;;;;;;x

anglican_DESC;Best known as the state religion of antediluvian Britain, the Anglican Church is a Protestant faith that regards itself as a 'via media', a middle way between Catholicism and Protestantism. Traditionally, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England is the British monarch, with the de facto leader of the Anglican Communion being the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, the Event saw to it that both vanished from the face of the Earth - the collapse of Old Britain led to the collapse of the Church. The conquests of Arthur Crowtemple marked the disappearance of the last Archbishop, and the Anglicans were left with nobody to guide them. Soon, the rise of Thelema as the new state religion of Britain led to Anglicanism being perceived as little more than a footnote in history. That being said, a faith is never truly dead as long as someone believes in it, and so it is not impossible for the Church of England to return to its former glory.;;;;;;;;;x

However, this persecution only emboldened them more, as many members began preaching secretly in the countryside towns of Central Europe. As a goal, the Utraquists seek to create their own domain, and are eager to spread their beliefs far and wide.;;;;;;;;;x

zaydi;Zaydi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;Zaidiyyah, occasionally known as Fiver Shias, is one of the Shia sects closest in terms of theology to the Ibadi and Mutazila schools. Zaidiyyah emerged in the eighth century from Shi'a Islam. Zaidis are named after Zayd ibn Ali, the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali and the son of the fourth Imam Ali ibn 'Husain. Following the event it has attempted to consolidate its position in Yemen in an effort to protect itself during this era of tribulation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Ismaili;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;The Ismaili Shi'ites are those who accept Isma'il ibn Jafar as the legitimate successor to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, unlike the mainstream Twelver Shias, who accept his younger brother Musa al-Kadhim. Historically, the Ismailis reached the peak of their political power in the age long before the Event, with the Fatimid Caliphate. However, in the intervening centuries, they have dwindled somewhat, being further subdivided into sects. In the chaos of the Event, many Ismaili sects have been absorbed by others, and now most Ismailis accept the Aga Khan as their lord. Theologically, Ismailis tend to be more focused on the interior, mystical elements of Islam than are Twelvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Twelver Shi'ism is the largest branch of Shi'a Islam after the Event. Twelvers, like all Shi'ites, reject traditional caliphal succession, instead believing in the Twelve divinely ordained Imams, beginning with Imam Ali and ending with the occulted Imam Mahdi. Twelvers hold that the Imams are infallible successors to the Prophet, by hikmah (divine knowledge) inherited from him and his successors, and the only ones capable of guiding the whole of the ummah. Following the end of the world, Twelver communities have found safety and guidance under local clerics and mujtahids, awaiting the return of the divinely hidden Mahdi, who is to bring a new era of peace and prosperity to the world. Though a unified Twelver religious body does not exist, a new Marja al-Taqlid may yet be elected to guide the Shi'ites in preparation for the end times.;;;;;;;;;;x
sunni;Azhari;;;;;;;;;;x
sunni_DESC;The people of the Sunnah were hit particularly hard by the Event, for the great calamity destroyed many of Islam's most prestigious institutions and killed the vast majority of its adherents. What little people were left began to stray from Islam as a whole, embracing shirk and paganism over the truth and oneness of God. Despite all its losses, Sunni Islam in the Middle East survived the fires of the Event, reorganising under the Grand Imam of the Al-Azhar University in Egypt. Under the gentle guiding hand of the Grand Imam, the traditional Sufi tariqahs have seen a great recovery, as well as found militias to safeguard the faith. Many, however, do not recognise the Grand Imam as the true leader of Sunni Islam, and those who follow the Grand Imam have been dubbed the Azharites, their words finding little sway in the fringe territories of Islam. Until a new Caliph is elected to lead the ummat al-Islam, the situation is unlikely to change.;;;;;;;;;;x

Developed by teachers from all branches of Tibetan Buddhism during a time of tension and distrust between the different schools, the Rimé movement promotes multiple perspectives and the appreciation of all the different traditions and practices found within Buddhism - to much success. Though the goals and ideals of the movement have long since found its way into the hearts of Buddhists, and many choose to accept the Rimé way without dissociating from one of the major schools, there are those who adopt the Rimé way as the ideal Buddhist path in and of itself. These non-comformist Rimé practitioners find little value in a tradition by its own, choosing to instead draw from many sources at once and promoting cooperation between the schools and their teachers. The Rimé movement in a new, narrower sense, is no stranger to religious progress and reform, seeing as there is truth to be found wherever one may look.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_EB_creation;Egypt has since antediluvian times been a bastion of the Islamic faith, and usually, whomever ruled Egypt was one of the premier powers of the Islamic world, and it is still home to the Al-Azhar University, the premier centre of Islamic learning.

romuva7Desc;Ever since Paulius Juze overthrew the pagan Mindaugasid dynasty centuries ago, Lithuania has been a strong bastion of Catholicism, with the old pagan religion snuffed out so thoroughly that it was difficult to practice it even in private. However, the recent fall of Lithuania to infidels has disgusted many of the zealous locals, who have banded together in an attempt to defend the faith. The new group calls itself 'The Purifiers' as a reference to Paulius Juze's nickname, "Purifier of Lithuania", and promise to fight unbelief everywhere, but especially in Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;x

yersenism_DESC;The Yarsan faith comes from the northwest region of Iran and northern Iraq. It has roots in indigenous Persian faiths like Zoroastrianism, to whom they are closely related. Yarsanis believe in the reincarnation of the soul, but also of God, and that in each Epoch there are seven Haftan who accompany God on Earth in mortal form. The last major presence of God on Earth was Soltan Sahak, who is said to have been born from his virgin mother, and when he grew of age he instructed the Kurdish tribes in the dogma of Yarsanism. With the collapse of the world order, the Yarsani have declared it to be the fifth epoch. No longer bound to their mountain lands, they strike forth in their search for the next incarnation of Xwedê.;;;;;;;;;x

sisukkuus_DESC;The concept of "sisu" has always been integral to life in Finland. Outsiders consider them nothing more than a disciplined people, but to Finns that discipline is just one of many things necessary to attain good sisu. Sisu is a life force that is innate to all living beings, and it forms a scale with a fragile balance. On one end, bad sisu will make a man corrupted and infirm, while good sisu will give that same man inhuman strength and combat prowess. Upon death, one's sisu will determine whether they ascend to Ylijumala's realm as a deity themselves, or fall into manala and be cursed to suffer for eternity. As an example, Sisuists believe that the Marshal was able to defend Finland against invaders for decades without losing vigor thanks to his good standing in life, while the wicked Lord Stalin was turned into a frail madman as a result of stealing divinity, becoming a cursed god worshipped only by the insane.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;

apostolic_DESC;The "Igreja Romariana", or "Romarian Church" is the legal successor to the Catholic church of Brazil. After the chaos of the Event, many Brazilians abandoned the Church, believing that Rome is gone, and with it the Pope. A small, but dedicated number of Sedevacantist Catholics held out, believing the Pope was simply too far to contact. Centuries passed, and the Romarian Church became the dominant Christian faith in most of Brazil, having absorbed many schismatic churches that rejected the Pope in Rome. It only grew to widespread prominence when the kings of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Espírito Santo and the dukes of Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe agreed to adopt it as part of their temporary alliance. By 2555, contact with Rome has been reestablished, and the Patriarch of Aparecida sits as the formal head of Brazilian Catholicism as contacting the Pope in Rome requires a perilous journey across the Atlantic. All adherents east of the Atlantic Ocean answer to the Archbishop of Cabo Verde, who in turn serves as the intermediary between the Pope and the Patriarch. Romarians reject the Sevillian Pope, believing him to be yet another schismatic like the ones that were struck  down in Brazil many years before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

espiritista_DESC;Spiritism, also called Kardecism, is a religious movement founded by the great pre-Event mystic Kardec, who sought to explain the fate of the soul after the death of the mortal body. Contrary to all Christian thinkers before him, he claimed the soul does not immediately leave the Earth, but reincarnates back into material existence. Spiritists still believe their beliefs are Christian, though they frequently clash with official Church doctrine, due to some Spiritist sects rejecting the Holy Trinity and martyrdom of Jesus. Over time, it grew to influence all aspects of Brazilian religious life, even finding its way over the Atlantic Ocean. While most Spiritist religious movements were driven out of the limelight by the Romarian inquisitions, its influence still persists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, not long after his ascension, the King was called to war by Heaven, his duty being to save the world from evil. The King was then felled in battle, his body never to be found. While most dismiss this tale as being just that, an old legend, the Sebastianist faithful claim that King Sebastian was not killed, but ascended to Heaven to fulfil his role as the Son of God, the prophesied Messiah meant to return to the world in its greatest hour of need, on a foggy day. He will take up Portugal's throne once more, and bring forth the Quinto Império, the next kingdom of God on Earth.;;;;;;;;;x

cruzadista_DESC;Crusadism is a movement within the Romarian Catholic Church that sprung up not long after the Event. Initially claiming to represent the traditionalist parts of the Church, it eventually grew more and more radical, being excommunicated by the Patriarch of Aparecida in the year 2180. Whatever official Church support the movement had collapsed on that day, and its loudest supporters mostly retreated into the shadows. Then the first contact with Rome came, and with it came the knowledge of the state of the Holy See. The Catholic Church split in two, with its "legitimate" successor holding on to barely more than Italy, and practising all sorts of heresy the real Church would never support, like the marriage of priests. Thus, the remaining Crusadists of the New World elected their own Patriarch, one in communion with the true successor of Saint Peter, the Pope in Seville.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shindo_DESC;Korean shamanism, also known as Shindo, Mushindo or Muism, is the ancient animistic folk religion of Korea. It is said that in the years before the Event, a great War in Heaven took place between the Tyrannical Ruby Chairman and a mighty Dragon King, the culmination of which led to the near end of the world and the subsequent release of incredible amounts of spirits and energy into the world. Over time, this led to a large rise in the number of followers of shamanism in Korea, who now consider their task to be understanding and appeasing the many spirits released into the world. Korean folk beliefs include a wide variety of gods, spirits and supernatural beings, and shamans, known as mu, have an important role in their society. Shamans are chosen through a process known as shinbyeong, which the Shindo believe to be possession by a god and subsequent loss of self. Korean mythology largely differs from area to area, being mainly orally retold in the form of shamanic narratives and creation myths in rites known as gut, along with offerings to gods and spirits and rituals of song and dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinko_DESC;The Ryukyuan folk religion, also known as Shinko or Ryukyu Shinto, is the ancestral belief system of the Ryukyu islands, consisting of many deities, spirits and mythological creatures. Syncretic in nature, the Ryukyuan religion has over the centuries been influenced by a variety of religions, mainly Buddhism and traditional Chinese faiths like Taoism and Confucianism. The Shinko believe in the existence of mabui, a form of spirit or soul integral to every person, being their very essence and defining characteristic. At the center of Shinko worship are their Ultimate Ancestors, those being Utin (the father), Jiichi (the mother), and Ryugu (the sea), as family and reverence of ancestors are highly emphasised in Ryukyuan religion. Though not explicitly shamanistic, mediums and healers known as the kaminchu have an important role in their faith. Especially important are the female kaminchu, known as the noro, who formally act as priestesses and caretakers of Shinko temples, at times even acting as important political figures or priestess-queens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinto_DESC;Shinto is the main faith of Japan. This polytheistic faith revolves around Kami, spiritual entities that exist in all things. The various Kami are revered in shrines and the most important ones have extensive temples built for them. Shinto priests, called kannushi, celebrate Kami with kagura dances and seasonal festivals, ensuring their continued protection over their land. While all Kami receive some form of reverence, even if only in the form of small shrines, it is undeniable that certain Kami, such as Amaterasu or Ebisu, are more revered. After the Event, the role of Yokai, monstrous spirits, has grown into Shinto, the spirits becoming known as entities that are believed to hold negative influence over the world and thus opposed to the Kami. Divided into Mamono, Mononoke, Ayakashi and other groups, Yokai are greatly feared by Shinto followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bushinto_DESC;Western Shinto is a recent branch of Shinto that has developed through the influence of Amida Shinto over the Shinto practices of Shikoku and easter Chugoku. This faith places emphasis on the defense and unity of the Shinto followers of Japan, believing that, if Japan is unified and isolated, the Kami will celebrate this unity by bestowing their protection upon the land, granting bountiful harvests and health to the land, so long as its followers do not try to extend themselves upon other people. Western Shinto followers particularly fear the water spirits known as Ayakashi, and Seiryu, the eastern blue dragon that is said to have once punished Japan for its hubris and cruelty by destroying two of its greatest cities, and as contrast follow particularly Bishamonten and his companions, the Seven Gods of Fortune or Shichifukujin, and the gods that once shielded Japan from an invasion, Fujin and Raijin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jun_kokoro_ha_DESC;Jun Kokoro-Ha is a militant sect of Pure Land Buddhism that wishes to establish a theocratic state across Japan ruled under Buddhist principles. They also seek to end the worship of the Kami, though would still support the Emperor if he were to bow to their righteous ways. Unlike the other sects of Japanese Buddhism, this sect was cast out of the fold for its overly violent means of attaining their goal, now being seen as heretical by the core Pure Land Buddhist sects. This sect organises itself into regional autocephalous temples with no single leader, and encourages meditation through training of skills while reciting the Pure Land Sutras.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

caodai;Cao Ðài;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
caodai_DESC;Cao Ðài, full name Ðai Ðao Tam Ky Pho Ðo meaning The Great Faith for the Third Period of Redemption, is a syncretic movement born in Vietnam. Their beliefs draw from many different sources: ethical precepts from Confucianism, occult practices of Taoism, theories of karma and rebirth from Buddhism, and hierarchical organisation of Catholicism. The Cao Ðài believe that in the ancient antediluvian age, a man named Ngô Minh Chiêu was given a vision from the Divine Eye of God and was told to spread the faith far, as man will not find universal peace without one universal faith. They claim that many men have been given the will of the Highest Power throughout history, though their words have since been perverted by their followers. As a result, they revere many religious leaders, such as Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha, as saintly figures. In the days after the Event, however, the Cao Ðài have long struggled with persecution from Siam and Vietnam, and the Caodaist Church has since cut all ties with rulers of both empires and turned inwards in an act of self-preservation, though it remains to be seen if its followers would choose the Empire or their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

neoncult_DESC;The Neon Cult recites the story of the Sun Mother Xihe, who mothered Jinwu, the Sun, and would send it out each day from the eastern land of Fusang. For thousands of years the world was tranquil under her guarding light, and people lived in harmony with nature, for both were nourished by the great star. However, as the world evolved, so did mankind's desires, and they sought to reach the Sun and harness its power, which greatly angered Xihe. In an act of self-preservation, Xihe brought the Sun closer to the earth, causing great mayhem. The world was in jeopardy until the Divine Archer Hou Yi shot the Sun out of the sky, killing Xihe in the process. Since that day, her faithful roam the world in search of fragments of Jinwu, the Living Sun, cultivating its light within sacred ceramic vessels. These are all brought to the Shanghai Sun Temple, where Xihe is said to resurrect upon her effigy's completion, so she may finally engulf the world in rapturous purification, and all may ascend to her in Fusang.;;;;;;;;;x

juche_DESC;A religion practiced in the People's Empire of Korea, Jucheists believe it was founded when Hwaning, a celestial deity sent his song Hwanung to Korea, which was then ruled by cruel foreigners, to broadly benefit the Korean Minjok.

The first two Emperors of this line alongside Hwaning are understood to form Sangje, the Heavenly Ruby Chairman and one God, as a trinity with multiple qualities.

wuxia;Wuxia;;;;;;;;;x
wuxia_DESC;The Wuxia path is said to date to the very beginning of time, when the First Shifu wrote the Xia Code, which all warriors must follow in order to cultivate their qi. True enlightenment can only be attained on the path of the Xiake, seeking to right the wrongs of the world by bettering themselves, not harming others, and helping those in need - thus harnessing the flux of qi within their body and becoming a xian. Practitioners of Wuxia are divided into various sects, each embracing the teachings of many ancient masters. Great respect is also paid to the bodhisattvas, who were not warriors, but achieved enlightenment through good deeds, proving that the Wuxia path is not one of violence.;;;;;;;;;x

Despite those claims, their envisioned Kingdom of God never came to fruition. And so, the remaining adherents concluded that their goal will never be fulfilled as long as the Great Red Dragon continues to oppress humanity while adhering to the word of their prophet.;;;;;;;;;x

legalist_DESC;The revival of Chinese legalism largely began in the academic circles of the waning Hong Dynasty. These neo-Legalists believe that the empires of Tianxia were built in the image of Heaven's divine bureaucracy, according to the precepts laid down by the First Emperor and his great sages. They hold that the First Emperor recreated Heaven to such a perfect degree that the gods blessed him with immortality, elevating him and his entire court to divinity. Their laws and principles would guide the Middle Kingdom for millennia until the Hong Dynasty, whose rulers sought to overthrow the ancient order, and were punished greatly by Heaven as a result. Legalist scholars, though willing to delve into various methods of governance of the old dynasties, strictly follow the principles laid down in the Hanfeizi, as Heaven's mandate depends on it.;;;;;;;;;x

gaibang_sect_desc;The Gai Bang Sect, also known as the Clan of Beggars, is a powerful yet unprestigious school of Wuxia. The Gai Bang Sect's origins are shrouded in mystery, and it is viewed as the sect of the isolated and downtrodden - those who cannot afford to learn from great masters.

emei_sect;Emei Sect;;;;;;;;;x
emei_sect_desc;The Emei Sect is most famous within Wulin for being exclusively led by women - although many men are inducted into its ranks, most of the highest ranking members are female.

red_cult_DESC;The Red Sun movement, originally founded by students of Liehuo thought, holds that Yan Di did not send the Eight Armies to destroy the infallible Hong. Unwilling to believe that a god would smite his own children, he instead sent forth a hero to protect them from the Eight Armies' destruction - the Red Sun. They hold that Hong Taiyang saved the world from total annihilation by slaying the Azure Dragon of the West and dispersing his armies, but was killed in battle, returning to Heaven. However, his duty is not over, and his followers believe he will be restored back on earth once true harmony is met, ruling over all Tianxia as the true Son of Heaven. It will be a long time until then, as there can be no harmony while those who undermine the fallen Hong still persist.;;;;;;;;;x
gidoggyo_DESC;Also known as 'The Way of Christ', Gidoggyo is a set of scriptures and traditions dating back to Antediluvian customs. It is hotly debated where its true origins may lie, and what route it could have taken to its lands.

Gidoggyo sects follow tenants of virtue and a rejection of 'sinfulness'.;;;;;;;;;x
