pancasila_DESC;The Pancasila faith is a relatively new addition to the island of Indonesia. Claiming to follow the teachings of their grand antediluvian leader Sukarno and acting more as a set of philosophical and political beliefs rather than a religion, its adherents believe themselves to be the true continuation of the old world state of Indonesia. All Pancasila rulers consider themselves mere governors in a great Indonesia, regardless if they act independently or not. Those who believe in Pancasila claim that yang Maha Esa gave Sukarno the Five Principles and Thirty-Seven Commandments so that he could lead the people of Indonesia against the forces of wickedness who enslaved the people of Indonesia during his time and lead Indonesia into an age of peace and unity, which they could once again bring if they follow the Principles and Laws. Its followers are very tolerant of any monotheistic religion, seeing them as yet another aspect of yang Maha Esa and are quite charitable to the commoners as the Fifth Principle demands social justice for all Indonesians.;;;;;;;;;x

concordianist_DESC;The Concordianist Church considers itself the sole legitimate successor of the greatest polity the Old World had ever seen - Europa itself. From the days of Charlemagne all the way to the Event, wise Europa functioned as one, unified in diversity. Though Europa has since fallen, they believe she is destined to rise again, as she has many times before. Thus, the Concordianists do not believe it is the destiny of any one man to unite the whole continent by his hand, but rather the collective destiny of all of Europe, once they come to realise their strength in unity. Guided by the many Fathers of Europe, such as Plato, Kant, and Hegel, who themselves have been guided by the divine hand of Providence, the Concordianists, though fallen far from grace, now comprise some of the greatest artists and philosophers in post-Event Europe. Throughout many courts of Europe can be heard the odes to the glory of Europa Regina, reinforcing the fact that though she may have ceased to exist as a polity, she forever lingers on as an idea in the hearts of men. Those whose souls have been touched by the pan-European ideals of the Concordianists venture to Brussels, where Europa first embodied herself as an angel atop a white bull, and a grand cathedral was built atop the hill where the old institutions are buried. Together, they work towards the return of a unified Europa, the Daughter of Elysium.;;;;;;;;;x

ahmadiyya_DESC;A form of Islam native to the Indian subcontinent. Ahmadi Muslims believe that a messianic figure known as the Mahdi, named Ahmad, came down to India before the Event, announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam, or else be destroyed. To those who accepted him he showed the new way of peace, and proclaimed that Islam would no longer be spread by the sword, but by more peaceful means. To those who rejected him, he issued condemnations. The Event then fell upon the people for their lack of faith, while the chosen people remained safe, hidden from the wrath. Now, under the guidance of their Caliph, the Ahmadiyya go forth once again, to preach the religion of peace to every corner of the ruined world.;;;;;;;;;x

amaitist_DESC;One of the first organised religions founded after the Event, Amaitism is a syncretic faith founded by the prophet Amaité in southern California. Amaitists claim that their prophet was formerly a Zoroastrian, given divine revelation by Ahura Mazda. Amaitism states that Ahura Mazda consists of a trinity, with the great prophets of history - Zoroaster, Jesus and Buddha - being emanations of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit respectively.  Jesus is the Son of God, whose great sacrifice removed the original sin from mankind, and Zoroaster and Buddha are prophets who spent their days teaching the common man how to enter Heaven by escaping the cycle of rebirth that all humans are otherwise destined for. For each aspect of the Trinity, Ahura Mazda created a counter - forces of chaos meant to bring balance. Angra Mainyu created the material world, Satan created the sins of man and Mara created the cycle of rebirth. Without each divine aspect having its opposite, the world cannot function. Amaitists also believe non-believers can enter heaven, though they have a harder time doing so by rejecting the teachings of Amaité, as it was revealed to them that the great religions of the world are merely single aspects of a single God's plan. Depictions of Amaité are forbidden, the line being drawn at an androgynous figure with a burning face, as they were never an emanation of God, merely a messenger. As such, their final request was for them to be forgotten, not wanting to be deified themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sarna_pagan_DESC;Sarnaism is a folk religion practised primarily by the Kurukh and Munda peoples and spread throughout the Chota Nagpur plateau in eastern India. Claiming to be an ancient belief system existing since time immemorial, Sarnaism, known locally as Sarna Dhorom and to outsiders as the Religion of the Holy Woods, is a nature worshipping pagan faith largely detached from surrounding Hindu and Abrahamic religions. Though syncretism is commonplace, Sarnaists reject the Varna system and ignore any foreign religious texts, instead turning inwards, focusing on protecting and nurturing the nature around them. Having a vast and inconsistent amount of deities and spirits, the most frequently worshipped supreme creator is the Sun, known as Dharmes, a force of unquestionable good. The sacred Sarna grove is of especial importance, and it is believed the groves are the abode of Chala Pachchho, a powerful female deity commonly identified as a mother goddess of earth and nature. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which adherents celebrate marriage between the Earth and the Sun and offer sacrifices to village deities.;;;;;;;;;x

The supreme deity of the Sarna religion is the Sun god Dharmes, who is believed to be the force of unquestionable good in the world, hampered only by human vices. Sarnaists believe that the old world was struck down by Dharmes as punishment for mankind's destruction of nature, and consider it their main duty to preserve and protect nature from those who wish to exploit and destroy it. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which priests called Pahan offer sacrifices to the mother goddess Chala Pachchho and ancestral spirits, celebrating marriage between the Earth and the Sun.;;;;;;;;;x

qingzhen_DESC;Islam in China goes by many names - "Orthodox religion", "Cubic religion" or simply "Hui religion", but one word that is used by its followers to exemplify its virtues is "Qingzhenjiao", or the "Pure and True Religion". Due to its isolation from the wider ummah by successive Chinese governments, the Muslims of China have adopted peculiar practices influenced by the local Confucian and Daoist philosophies and other new Chinese religious traditions, such as ancestor veneration and a generally Confucian social outlook. In fact, many Muslims in China consider Confucius on par with the Prophet Muhammad, dubbing him the "Sage of the East" as opposed to the Prophet's status as the "Sage of the West". They will often translate Islamic concepts using Confucian terminology, culminating in the near-syncreticism of Confucianism and Islam present in many of their religious works, such as the Han Kitab, or the use of Taoist clothes by certain members of their Sufi orders.;;;;;;;;;x

akjang_DESC;Ak Jang is an indigenous religion that flourished among the Altai people of Russia's Altai Republic during the 1900s. The Russian Empire was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers and thus suppressed it. The religion was originally millenarian, charismatic and anti shamanic, the movement gradually lost most of these qualities becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized and accommodating itself to the pre existing Altaian folk religion. It is derived from a combination of Tengriism, Buddhism and Khurmaztism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He told the animals, rocks, plants and ancestor spirits to which moeity they would belong to, passing down the male line. Spirits known as Wandjina also play an important role among the Kimberley Clans. The Wandjina are protective and totemic spirits contained within rock paintings who are maintained and repainted by local peoples. They appear in many of the creation stories of the land. Additionally, there is reverence for the Rainbow Serpent Lumuru, who is a servant to Wolaro. Lumuru delivers spirit-children into the womb of women, making them pregnant, and transforming said spirit into flesh and blood.;;;;;;;;;x

The world is divided into the underworld, the Earth and heaven, the ancestors of humans having descended from heaven in ancient times. The earthly authority, whose words and actions should be cleaved to both in life and death , is called a To Minaa. Aluk is not just a belief system, it is a combination of law, religion, and habit. Aluk governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of aluk may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals.

Despite being cut off from contact with the rest of the church by the Event, the Mormon faithful have endured in either small pockets or wandering congregations scattered across Eurasia. While considering themselves Christians, due to their heterodox beliefs (including a non-Trinitarian nature of God, an open canon of scripture, and that the Christian Church needed to be restored due to apostasy) few faiths agree and consider them entirely seperate. These circumstances have made it difficult for any large population of Mormons to gather in one place for long, and so many content themselves to simply live and preach their faith until a day comes where they can find a homeland for themselves.;;;;;;;;;x

rastafari_DESC;Rastafari is the religion of the Rastas, founded in Jamaica. They are worshippers of Jah, the God of all. According to them, the Event was caused by the decadent forces of Babylon getting struck down by Jah, in the form of Ras Tafari, the manifestation of Jah and the Emperor of Zion. The Rastafari hold that after the Event, Ras Tafari returned to Jah, leaving behind Zion as the new paradise on Earth, ruled by the faithful. Many Rastas believe it is now their duty to return to Zion, their promised land, though many others hold they are also meant to spread Jah's love to all corners of the world, including what remains of Babylon.\nThe Rastas believe Jah is present in every person, a concept they call "I and I", expressing the connection between all people by Jah. Rastas strictly adhere to the concept they call livity, which means leading a righteous life in order to gain awareness and oneness with Jah, the primary goal in a Rasta's life. To that extent, livity means frequent prayer, meditation, oneness with nature, and most important of all, oneness and love for others. Their prayers are often very mystical, involving the use of psychedelic herbs and becoming aware of oneness with Jah. Lacking formal hierarchy or doctrine, the Rastafari are quite disunited in their beliefs, being divided into three main denominations, or "Mansions" - the Bobo Ashanti, the Nyabinghi Order, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, each with their own distinct doctrines, though they are united by their love of Jah. In the old world the religion is primarily found in various American Quarters of the Nigerian Empire, across its various cities, the largest being in Lagos, the Imperial capital.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Formally monotheistic, Balinese worship is focused primarily on a supreme being called Acintya, also known as Sang Hyang Tunggai or Sang Hyang Widi Wasa. Worship of the Trimurti is commonplace, whom they consider to be manifestations of Acintya, occasionally identified as Shiva or Siwa-Sadasiwa-Paramasiwa.

girondist_DESC;The Girondins are a deistic faith that believes the many gods of Europe are merely individual facets of a single great, incomprehensible Architect of Creation, who made man in his image spiritually, but not physically. Because man is of the Creator, it is also man who is to rule over other men, with those of the First Estate being chosen by the Creator to rule. However, should a monarch fall to his basal desires, and fail to uphold the duties and virtues bestowed upon him by God, it is the duty of the Third Estate to dethrone him and feed him to Madame Guillotine. It is in this way that Girondists uphold the balance of the universe, for it was Madame Guillotine who brought the Event once every ruler on Earth was a corrupt tyrant. The three archangels of God - Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, embody the principles a just and righteous ruler is to live by, and are also those who bring the Third Estate to depose a tyrant. Though once a widespread religion in France, the rise of Númenor and Novelism has seen it fall by the wayside and incorporate heavy syncretism with their Novelist cousins, the two religions slowly but surely blending into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Worship is focused on the goddess Kali as the main and most important manifestation of Brahman. Influenced by the teachings of the pre-Event guru Ramakrishna, modern Kali worship largely emphasises devotion (bhakti) over ritual, and as a result brahmin influence has greatly dropped after the Event. Other than Kali, worshipped deities include the Mahavidyas, Kaumari, Chandi, Durga, and many more regional gods and goddesses. Kali as the Supreme Being is considered both the loving mother of her children and their fierce guardian, and by extent the destroyer of evil. Worship is most often communal and carried out through festivals such as Kali Puja.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, their failure to find the universal panacea, the cure of all disease, led to their downfall, with plague wiping the slate of the Old World clean. Now, the Nobelians are masters in the arts of alchemy, chemistry, medicine, archaeology, and everything in between, seeking to restore old lost knowledge, and educate many in the arts of their ways in their lavish Old World universities. They are guided by Hermes, the ancient god of wisdom, and will stop at nothing to right the wrongs of the Old World before it is too late to prevent another Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orleanist_DESC;Arcencism, colloquially called Jeannism, is a sect of French Catholicism that has developed a cult-like following of Jeanne d'Arc. According to legend, Jeanne led France to victory against the worshippers of the wicked Queen long before the Event in the fabled Siege of Orléans. She was given the sword Joyeuse by the angel Marianne, which she used to smite the Queen as instructed by Saint Michael in a battle of Heaven and Earth. Vengeful, the Queen's worshippers made a pact with Satan, bewitching the Pope into branding Jeanne as a heretic, executing her and tarnishing her legacy for years to come.\nThough the Church has since absolved Jeanne and declared her a Saint, her loyal followers haven't forgotten the treachery committed against her by Albion and the Papists, and years of tension in the post-Event world led to the formal excommunication of the Jeannist leaders and the religion being declared heretical. Even though the Catholic Church in France has long since met its end, the Jeannists have held steadfast in their fortresses, attracting more people than ever to their Crusade after the British took over Northern France, seeking to banish Albion and their resurrected Demon-Queen from the mainland and into the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dahatatta_DESC;Deha Tatta, meaning "truth in the body", is the name of the central theme and purpose of the songs of the Bauls. Bauls are the mystic troubadours of eastern India, who perform enigmatic songs and spread a message of love. Their music and poetry, called Baul sangeet, preaches about finding relationship with God and achieving spiritual liberation, seeking divinity within each person. They believe one should always be searching for Moner Manush - the "Man of their Heart", or the divine spirit of God manifested inside the body. Followers of Deha Tatta are as such devoted to Sadhana, the spiritual practice of transcending material things through purified love and devotion. The Bauls themselves come from various backgrounds, both from within the religion and from neighbouring religions like Islam and Hinduism. This act of coming together to preach love and mysticism has resulted in a unique blend of religions that has taken over Bengal since the Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

vostokist_DESC;It did not take long in the chaos surrounding the event for banditry, chaos, and upstart cults to overtake the Russian Orthodox Church in the far east. Priests, monks, and the few remaining believers found themselves struggling to hold onto their lives and faith, the believers struggled to preserve what artifacts and texts they could as Cathedrals were ransacked, converted, or destroyed. The remaining believers found refuge within a range of communities deep in the Siberian far east finding a home where they could build new monasteries and in their isolation developed several distinct interpretations of the bible. The Far East Church differs from standard Orthodox Theology with their adoption of a far more mystical and esoteric outlook on God and heaven with an emphasis on the unknowability of God who they refer to only indirectly using terms such as "the one" or "the whole". The Far east church also developed a strong ascetic tradition with numerous Monks or Saints performing public mortification of the flesh in order to sever their connection to the sinful material world and contemplate the infinite nature of the mind of the One, Such Mortification commonly includes self immolation as well as a revival of the Stylite traditions where a Monk will live on tall pillars or on tree tops meditating where they contemplate the One and preach their revelations to their community until their death. Vostokists believe that in death all souls are required to be purified for some time, and that in this state of purification all souls are connected and may influence each other. Vostokists believe that the event was caused due to an overabundance of sinful souls whoch has caused mankind's connection to God to be severed causing a backflow of sinful thought to destroy the world and all subsequent souls since then to enter a state of disconnect from God dooming them to a state of existence without connection to the One: Hell. Vostokists believe that it is the goal of the Saints to redeem the collective soul of mankind and restore mankind's divine link to God and to combat the devil who they believe exists within the collective evil thoughts and sins of all mankind seeking to doom all to an eternity without The Ones guidance once they are resurrected on the day of judgement.;;;;;;;;;x

raelian_DESC;One of the many faiths that survived the great calamity in France, Raëlism traces its roots back to the mythical pre-Event prophet known as Raël. The religion teaches that humanity was designed and created by an extraterrestrial race known as the Elohim. This was revealed to Raël by one of these creatures named Eru L'Auteur, who explained to him the truth of the universe. Claiming to be the leader of the Elohim and the creator of humanity, he reveals that, throughout all of history, he had created a total of 40 Elohim-human hybrids on Earth, who served humanity as prophets - among them being The Buddha, Jesus Christ, Charlemagne, and Napoleon, with Raël himself being the 40th and final prophet. Raëlians claim that the world entered its current age, the Age of Destruction, in the pre-Event year of 1945, with an event called "the Atomic Bombing", in which a faraway planet called Hiroshima was annihilated by a great explosion caused by humans, after which humanity turned on each other and became dedicated to its own destruction, culminating in the Event itself and their near-total extinction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They believe in a universalist world view of religion, claiming that there is one God, who is incomprehensible, and whose will has been and will be manifested throughout time in an endless series of revelations and theophanies given to the prophets of man. These Manifestations of God have been revealed to prophets progressively throughout history, unifying humanity in purpose, with interpretations differing according to societal needs. As a result, the Bahá'í are ardent advocates of world peace and unity, with their single greatest goal being that of a single world order where everyone can prosper, regardless of their race, nation, or beliefs.;;;;;;;;;x

baptist_DESC;Born in antiquity, Baptism is a strain of Protestantism that is highly charismatic and vigorous. It believes that only adult believers should be baptised, and that too by full bodily immersion in water. They reject most of the Catholic sacraments and follow a Congregational model of Church governance. Baptists after the Event became isolated from their homeland in America, and mostly exist as religious minorities throughout Asia due to prior missionaries evangelizing heavily there. In northeastern India, they became a majority and established the first Baptist kingdom in the Old World. In other areas, smaller Baptist congregations desperately fight for survival.;;;;;;;;;x

This lack of organisation has led to the festering of some heterodox practices, such as local scripture, local spirit worship, and most egregiously, self-immolation.;;;;;;;;;x

penitente;Penitente;;;;;;;;;x
penitente_DESC;The Penitente are a group of Sevillianists who preach that humanity, and especially the Spanish people, are full of guilt and do not deserve salvation. They preach that the only hope to avoid eternal damnation is to accept one's guilt and do penance in order to be absolved by the Lord when he sees sincere repentance. Penances can be very varied, including self-flagellation, crucifixion, etc., but all of them usually coincide in that the penitent must suffer great pain during the penance so that his guilt can be absolved. All this is due to the fact that long before the event, when brothers were killing each other in a supposed holy war, a false prophet arose. This false prophet was none other than the antichrist who deceived the people of Spain that he had been sent by God Himself to restore the worship of the Lord and eradicate the wicked and degenerate from this land. The church in Spain instead of seeing through the lies of the antichrist, blinded by their hatred, wholeheartedly supported the antichrist, shepherding the people of Spain straight into the jaws of the beast. The antichrist demanded from the people their praise for being sent by god under threat of death for anyone who refused, the slaughter was such that he founded lakes and rivers throughout Spain with the blood of his victims. Fortunately the Lord did not abandon his people and sent his archangel Raphael to kill the antichrist, after which he punished the world with the event.;;;;;;;;;x

osvicenism_DESC;A faith originating in the wake of the event in the previously extremely atheistic nation of Czechia, Osvicenism is a fusion of both Christian and Buddhist beliefs which had grown significantly in popularity within the nation. Founded by a Czech Buddhist Monk who had been raised a Catholic, he found a way to unite his disparate beliefs together under one system which appealed to the people across Czechia and Goralia. Later this system of belief would spread east by several Monks to the Buddhists of Kalmykia, converting many and becoming a stronghold of the faith. It espouses that while it was to the Buddha that God revealed how one may ascend to heaven, it was only available to the most ascetic of monks, it was only through the sacrifice of Christ that this pathway was made open to all. It views sins such as Pride or Lust as faults which must be overcome by meditation on their meaning and the emotional state which they cause. Only by conquering these faults across multiple lifespans may a person purify themselves and therefore escape the cycle of Birth, Death, Purgatory and Rebirth which all but the most ascetic monks are trapped within. Those ascetics are close to fulfilling their escape to heaven where they will join God as saints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wuist_DESC;Wujiao refers to the various shamanic religious traditions of the Sinitic populations of China. Chinese shamanism is intrinsic to Chinese folk religion and is fairly diverse. Various rituals and traditions are rooted in this belief system, such as Ritual Masters being identified as Wu by outsiders, though most adherents don't self-identify as such. In addition, Daojiao developed partially from Wujiao, as it focused around the pursuit of a long life, or the status of becoming a Xian, otherwise known as a holy man. Having been suppressed and stigmatized in pre-Event China, the religion post-Event had experienced a small revival but remains heavily fragmented. Wuists have generally opted to remain outside of the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanminshuyi debate regarding the war in Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

Calling themselves "children of Ragnarök", the vikings of the northern seas hold that the Event was Ragnarök come to end the world. The prophecies foretold came true one by one, with the Old Gods being slain in the great calamity. The world serpent Jörmungandur poisoned the water and sky and ended life as the Old World knew it alongside Surtur and Fenrir. The world survived their onslaught though, and though the Old Gods perished in their twilight, their kindred came to inherit their roles and end Ragnarök. Thus, the New World is watched over by Baldur and Hod, who lead a new pantheon of benevolent deities, while the Old Gods are all either dead or mere husks of their former selves. They are often malevolent and considered signs of bad luck, unable to let go of a world that moved on.;;;;;;;;;x

calvinist_DESC;Born long before the Event in the mountains of Switzerland, the Reformed Churches follow the Protestant tradition as laid down by the great sage Calvin and his like-minded reformers. The Calvinists strongly believe in the concept of predestination, in which the salvation of men is pre-determined by God long before their judgement. This belief extends to the question of rule, with many Calvinists believing that he who is not destined to go to Heaven is not destined to rule either.\nThe Church itself was supposedly never claimed by the fires of the Event, being saved by the legendary Emperor Jürgén from destruction. The Council of Geneva marked a turning point during those early days of the deluge, establishing Geneva as the home of the Church's Elder and the Calvinist Theocracy as the only valid form of temporal government. Soon after, the rest of the European Reformed Churches were brought back into the fold, and since then the Calvinists have been organising, preparing to sally forth from their mountains and retake what is rightfully theirs.;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;The Roman Catholic Church survived through the Event, like it did through so many other crises, great and small. It did not, however, come out unscathed. Though the state of the Church during the Event is murky at best, the Holy See was officially restored in the Year 2100, with the Keys of Heaven being given to Saint Adalbertus, the first legitimate successor to pre-Event Pope John Paul II. The Church has had many losses, losing large swathes of territory to pagans, heretics, and idolators, as well as suffering from the Sevillian Schism, where the faithful of Spain flocked to a rival Pope in Seville. Since then, the true Holy See has adapted to the post-Event world accordingly, allowing the marriage of priests and the appointment of female deacons to make up for the massive loss of life during the Event, as well as recognising a variety of local rites and the celebration of Vernacular Mass. Now, the Church may finally, for the first time in a long time, have the upper hand against its neighbours, and only time may tell if it will survive in this new changing world, as it has for countless millennia.;;;;;;;;;x

celtic_pagan_DESC;A ancient faith first revived on the Aran islands of Ireland, spreading to the nearby Galway, Mayo and Sligo. While not a direct successor, it has survived somewhat in the background of Ireland's long Christianization. It worships the spirits which inhabit all places in the world, having returned from the otherworld where they were banished by the Christian Saint Patrick. The event destroyed the barriers he put in place allowing the spirits to return once again. Of particular worship are water spirits as they give life. The ruler of these fae is Lir, Old King of the Sea, and his Swan children. The rulers of this faith are also Draoithe themselves and as such are permitted to directly hold temples.;;;;;;;;;x

genevist;Genevist;;;;;;;;;x
genevist_DESC;Genevism is a Calvinist movement founded, according to legend, right after the Event during the reign of Emperor Jürgen the Holy. The Genevists are named after the Council of Geneva, in which all Calvinist priests in Europe attended. The Council announced the proclamation of the Calvinist Theocracy as the official form of governance for the Alpereich, which caused a number of priests to storm out, leading to their excommunication and the subsequent founding of the Genevese Church. Following this schism, the Genevese Church eventually took more radical stances regarding Calvinist politics, advocating for total separation of the realm of God and the realms of men. According to the Genevese, all of God's laws cannot be realistically enforced on Earth, and as such Theocracy cannot be the ideal way to govern as it is fundamentally flawed. Though their popularity has waned in the years after the Council, relegating them to near obscurity, Genevese thought may yet be revived once theocratic rule fails the Calvinist faithful.;;;;;;;;;x

haymanot_DESC;This distinct sect of Judaism, practiced by the Betah Israeli Jews of Ethiopia has too survived the Event. Their Biblical texts have a few additions to the usual Jewish Bible. After the event, several old customs were revived, such as the unique monastic traditions that differ from the traditions of other Jews.;;;;;;;;;x
zoroastrian_DESC;Zoroastrians worship Ahura Mazda, the uncreated God, as proclaimed by the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster. It was the official religion of all Persian empires (except the Hellenic Seleucid Empire) until the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire in 651. The ancient form of the religion involved great sacred hill top fires and the exposure of dead bodies to scavenger birds for cleansing, while the modern form of this religion instead mainly focuses on the following of its primary creed, "Good Thoughts, Good Deeds, Good Words." As such, they are very generous and charitable despite the fact their religion has seriously declined in its number of adherents. The two largest surviving communities can be found in central Iran and Western India, though there was an attempt at revival in the Yarsani Kingdom of Kurdistan in recent history.;;;;;;;;;x
GOD_ZORVAN;Zorvan;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite;Neo-Zorvanite;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite_DESC;Based on a collection of texts uncovered by a Zoroastrian Priest in late 23rd century Tajikistan. This faith holds that the god of time Zorvan is father to both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu and that Zorvan guides humans destiny through various celestial implements. One key difference between this sect and its ancient forebearer is that it contends that Humans must have free will otherwise the command by Ahura Mazda to do good is pointless, thus a divine being would not state such. The faith looks slightly more favourably on Angra Mainyu than traditional Zoroastrianism due to him being one of Zorvan's sons. Additionally they believe that Zorvan's sons must both exist for there to be a universal balance, they believe that there can be no good without evil and no order without chaos to compare it to, while Ahura Mazda is the sibling worthy of worship Angra Mainyu should be respected for the role he plays in the natural order of Zorvan's weave. Because of these beliefs it was driven from its Tajik homeland by its fellow Zoroastrians and the religion found popularity amongst the Sarikoli. The religion generally speaking is not aggressive and if not for it's aggressive neighbours would continue residing amongst its mountain tribes.;;;;;;;;;x 
koranist;Qurani;Qurani;Qurani;;Qurani;;;;;;;;;x
koranist_DESC;Dating back to the early days of Islam, the Qurani believe that Islamic law and guidance should only be based on the Koran, thus opposing any religious authority of the hadiths as well as caliphs. It is their belief that God's message in the Koran is clear and complete as is and that it can be fully understood without referencing outside scriptures. In the post Event era, the Qurani are heavily persecuted and often branded as apostates. They themselves view other Muslims as corrupted and seek to bring Islam back to its original form.;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka;Pusaka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka_DESC;Pusaka, meaning Heirloom, is a term for a syncretic school of Sunni that has gained a widespread following in the lands of Nusantara. Born from a combination of Islam and various Indonesian and Malay native beliefs, spirituality, mysticism and shamanism have an important role in the Pusaka faith. Shamans, known as the dukun to Indonesians and the bomoh to the Malay, have an important role in society, considered to be healers and diviners. Weather shamans, known as the pawang, are believed to control the weather and tame wild beasts. There is a special emphasis on ancestral heirlooms, which are believed to house the spirits of ancestors and must be protected, and can give their owners extraordinary powers. Other than venerating the spirits of ancestors, the Pusaka also believe in a wide variety of supernatural entities, ranging from ghosts, known as the hantu, to imps, goblins, and familiars, all of which would either aid them or harm them through contracts and witchcraft. Despite incorporating a large amount of native beliefs and being denounced by mainstream Muslims as blasphemers and profaners, the Pusaka still firmly consider themselves Muslim, believing that only a powerful and pious Sultan can firmly unite Nusantara once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

syafi_DESC;Santri is an Islamic sect originating in Nusantara. It is named after students that pursue Islamic religious education in a "pesantren", a type of religious school which played a major role in the spread of Islam within the region. Largely the same as pre-Event orthodox Sunni Islam, the Santri sect has managed to largely avoid internal religious conflict and major distortions to theology through adaptation of local Malay folklore and practices to fit Islam instead of the other way around. Despite outward insistence on religious cohesion and Shafi'i legalism, private worship of Santri Islam tends to have many esoteric Sufist and mystic rituals, including the veneration of ancestral and nature spirits and the religious consumption of cannabis. Nonetheless, the Santri sect still stands tall as the most powerful faith in Nusantara, a position that comes with a theological battle against the syncretic Pusaka sect, a faith which threatens to erase Santri way of life from the history books.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
navayana;Navayana;;;;;;;;;x
navayana_DESC;Navayana is a school of Buddhism founded in the decades leading up to the event. Its founder, Bhimrao Ambedkar was born a Hindu, but however following his study of the Buddha's teachings he became convinced of its truth. He found that all currently existing schools of Buddhism had become overly esoteric and no longer thought the Buddha's lessons as he would have wished them. As such he created the "Buddh aur unaka dhamm" which was a recounting of the Buddha's teachings and life with the addition of commentaries added by Ambedkar. This was meant to remove some of the esotericism which had developed in the previously existing sects.;;;;;;;;;x

mattaism_DESC;A heresy spawned from just before the event from the theology of Father Matta El Meskeen. He came to blows with the Coptic papacy over the nature of original versus personal sin and the importance of personal faith in god over that of the collective faith in the church. He believed Original sin prior to Jesus was something that an individual could overcome through good deeds and that after the crucifixion one could overcome original sin by either accepting Jesus as their savior or through their own good deeds. As such Mattaists are extremely charitable to their impoverished citizens. He also believed in the total separation of the church and the state such that the church would not interfere with state policies. Overall the importance he placed on personal faith and his critiques of the Coptic church led to Mattaists believing post event that they no longer needed a papacy to govern them.;;;;;;;;;x

fraticelli_DESC;The Neo-Fraticelli, or 'New Little Brethren', is a Catholic heresy that was inspired by records of a medieval heresy of the same name. It is devoted to poverty and asceticism - especially for men of the cloth. Fraticelli heretics are violently opposed to Church wealth and displays of opulence among the populace. This is due to Mammon Prince of Greed being viewed as the demon King of the old world, he grew so powerful as to overthrow Lucifer Prince of Pride himself. He brought about the fall of the old world intentionally therefore the sin of greed is considered as fatal, if not more than, pride. They see the old world as a society of Pharisees who, instead of helping those in need, separated from them because they bothered their hearts.;;;;;;;;;x

Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the Subba or Sabians. The term Subba is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is Sabi. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that if every tyrant is removed from the face of the Earth, eternal prosperity will come to it, and so they try to go on grand campaigns to rid the world of these scum. Neo-Huguenots are heavily inspired by the Monarchomach theorists of pre-event France and consider tyrannicide to be a necessity in the fight for equality before God. They see feudalism as a tool for self-serving monarchs to consolidate more power for their selfish interests, so instead they follow a theocratic government where only the most pious and altruistic get to rule. The Queen of the Thelemites is considered to be the embodiment of a tyrant and her followers demon worshippers, and Novelists are known to have first brought back feudal law after the event, and so both are the main targets of Neo-Huguenot incursions. Catholics and other Protestants are both viewed with heavy distrust, as they both adhere to feudal structures and are also blamed for the destruction of the original Huguenots, a bitterness that never faded.;;;;;;;;;x

The theology of this heresy ponders the implications of the event that destroyed the world of men identifying It, as many Christians did, with the Last Judgement. But in particular, adherents of this branch of Orthodoxy asked themselves if the apocalypse came to the world, why haven't the dead been resurrected and the rightful called at the right of the Father. There are different interpretations of why this happened: some believe that during the Event the apocalypse happened in full, the dead were revived and the children of God judged. What remains of the world today is nothing but the tortures of hell. Others believe that the Event has only heralded the apocalypse and the only reason why the dead haven't been resurrected is that the earth was so full of sin that God rebuked it. Thus, the world now exists as a limbo between the Judgement of God and the damnation of Hell.;;;;;;;;;x

aurorean_DESC;The Aurorean faith is the disparate belief system of the coast and sea-dwelling Alaskans, spread widely across their homeland in the North Pacific, and varying wildly from city state to city state. The faith holds that there are three tiers of great spirits in their pantheon. The greater gods are aspects of Ellam Yua, the spirit of the universe, in the form of the Celestial Ram, the Earthly Ewe, and the Annointed Lamb, are beyond the mortal world of men and are the creators and orchestrators of the Earth, the sky, and all of life's symphonies. The lesser gods, such as the Raven and the Thunderbird, are those who live in the spirit world as mediators between the world of man and the world of gods, and control much of the earthly realm on the greater gods' behalf. Lastly are the various animistic spirits who inhabit the earth, sea, and sky, such as dwarfs and gnomes, and most importantly of all, the Aurorean Heavenly Host, a great army of spirits marching across the sky for which the religion is named. Aurorean shamans attempt to invoke the spirits for good luck, good weather, and bountiful seas, and the vast and elaborate creation stories of the frozen north are frequently retold at potlatches.;;;;;;;;;x

sedevacantist_DESC;The Gallicanist Papacy was formed in the year 2205, with the last Patriarch of Québec proclaiming himself Pope Bien-Aimé I. The Québécois Patriarchate was one of many positions in the newly-formed Council of Patriarchs, meant to hold Catholicism together in total absence of papal contact. Claiming to have received an apparition from the Blessed Virgin, the now-Pope declared the old Papacy forfeit, and forced a massive schism in the Catholic Church of Canada, with many bowing to his word as the new Vicar of Christ, and many more denouncing him as a fraud and a heretic. Ultimately, the Gallicanist Church held its own in the aftermath of ecclesiastical controversy, spawning a new line of American Popes. Whether or not this neo-Catholic Church will survive the eventual backlash of old Catholicism to come its way remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;x

tridemism_DESC;Sanminzhuyi is a faith based around the teachings of the great Sapphire Didact found in the book "Principle of Minsheng". The Sapphire Didact rose to prominence in a great war the century before the event during this war 8 great armies of barbarians led by demonic lords arrayed themselves against the Middle Kingdom, slaughtering millions, forcing the Emperor of China to seek divine assistance from the Jade Emperor to fight off these hordes. The Jade Emperor granted his aid to the Middle Kingdom and raised 8 Great Generals to semi-divinity to fight back against the hordes. The Sapphire Didact proved himself to be the greatest of these generals and alongside the sly Ruby Chairman who saw himself raised to full divinity by the Jade Emperor as reward for saving China. However, the Jade Emperor himself had too shown his weakness by allowing these demons to grow so powerful to begin with, and through the wisdom of the Sapphire Didact he concluded that his continued reign would prove disastrous for his beloved China. As such with the assistance of the sly Ruby Chairman he overthrew the Jade Emperor and forced him into hiding for a time. However it would not be long until the Ruby Chairman showed his true colours and overthrew the Sapphire Didact through deceit and cunning, forcing him to retreat to Taiwan. From there he has gradually extended his influence back to the mainland and seeks to reclaim his beloved China for the betterment of all it's peoples and a return to the harmony of the universe.;;;;;;;;;x
maoist_DESC;Liehuo follows the teachings of the Heavenly Ruby Chairman, ruler of the Heavenly Mandate of all. Though once a man, the Chairman ascended to godhood to protect China from the Eight Armies of Evil and the Event to restore harmony to the world after the Jade Emperor was deposed. He fought alongside one of the Jade Emperor's most powerful warriors, The Sapphire Didact, against these eight armies of barbarians and demons. Following their victory these two turned on each other for the throne of heaven and the followers of the Sapphire Didact were banished to Taipei, he still insidiously plots from his island realm among his followers. The Chairman's teachings are left behind in the Red Book for them to follow, so that they might achieve righteousness and not fall to the lies of either the old Jade Emperor or the Deceiving Sapphire Didact. They strongly believe in the obligation to spread the Ruby Chairman's influence to the rest of the world especially the holdouts of the Jade Emperor and Sapphire Didact.;;;;;;;;;x
taoist;Daojiao;;;;;;;;;x
taoist_DESC;Daojiao is a polytheistic religion originating in China, by the 26th century it is isolated to solely southern China following the rise of Liehuo in the north. While traditionally regarded as founded by Laozi the Supreme Old Lord in the 4th century BC, some elements and practices can be traced to prehistoric folk religions across the Middle Kingdom. The followers revere Tao, the underlying natural order of the Universe – the active expression of Tao for an individual is Te, the inner virtue. Daojiao also value life over death, and believe it possible to achieve immortality, through various methods, including spiritual practices and alchemy. One of its most important dieties, the Jade Emperor, is believed to have been betrayed by two of his servants in the century prior to the event and remains in conflict with them to this day. These two servants were his two greatest generals in the fight against a horde of barbarians led by a series of Demon lords from beyond the middle kingdom, the barbarians and their demon lords proved too mighty for china to overcome without divine assistance. The Jade emperor granted it and lifted 8 generals to semi-divinity they protected china and their two greatest leaders, the Ruby Chairman and the Sapphire didact as they are now known, were raised even higher to the rank of full divinity. But they believed that the Jade Emperor had grown weak to allow these demons to grow so powerful and sought to overthrow him. The religions of Sanminzhuyi and Liehuo represent their followers, this series of events has upset the balance of the cosmos which cannot be restored unless both of these rebellious servants are brought to heel.;;;;;;;;;x

They speak of Raven, a supernatural shapeshifting trickster, who is said to be the creator of humanity and, in some myths, the world itself. One story speaks of how Raven stole the Sun, Moon, and stars from the Sky Chief, who was keeping it away from people. Another story says that Raven freed the first humans out of a clam. That being said, while he is often credited with creating the world and liberating humanity, Raven does not do things out of the goodness of his heart, but to satisfy his curiosity and boredom, being always hungry for vanity.\nOther gods also frequently make their appearance in the Raven Tales, such as the Ocean Woman, the goddess of fertility and abundance of fish in the sea, and the twin deities Ta'xet and Tia, who represent violent and peaceful death respectively. Killer whale spirits are considered rulers of the underworld and reincarnations of deceased ancestors. These Raven Tales are passed down during the potlatch, a ceremonial gathering held to mark important events, such as the birth of a child or passing of an elder.;;;;;;;;;;;x

jacobinist_DESC;The Jacobins, members of a secret society in the highest echelons of European academia, are those who live to placate the eternal hunger of Madame Guillotine. Jacobins believe that many years before the Event, the prophet Robespierre was given this sacred duty by the Madame herself, but was soon killed by those unbelievers who considered him a madman. With Madame Guillotine left unfed, it was humanity that paid the price, the Madame taking back all the lives owed to her in the Event. With rivers of blood painting the streets of Europe red, the Jacobins slowly reemerged and reorganised, seeking to right the wrongs of their ancestors. Though denounced by the Girondins from whom they branched out of, and driven underground by the many other faiths of the continent, the Jacobins have slowly built up a web of informants and volunteers in Europe's universities, and only need the right time to strike.;;;;;;;;;x
communard;Communard;;;;;;;;;x
communard_DESC;The Communards are those Girondins who reject the First Estate as the one given mandate by God. Instead, they believe a ruler cannot uphold his duties if he isn't even of the same Estate, and as such they believe the only Estate capable of ruling over the Third Estate is itself. Communards believe only the lowest echelons of society can uphold Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, for they are the only ones who know what life is like without them. They also insist that Madame Guillotine will never be satisfied if she is fed the lives of those who have nothing to give, for it is the fat and the rich she yearns for. Thus, the Communards haven't only given themselves the noble goal of peasant liberation, but also believe it is their divine right to feed the whole of the First Estate to Madame Guillotine. As such, the Communards are heavily demonised and feared by the rulers and faiths of Europe, and rightfully so - for they have no compassion for the ruling classes and ask for none in return. When their turn comes, they will make no excuse for the terror to be unleashed.;;;;;;;;;x

jugoslavist_DESC;The Church of Saint Tito, though having deep roots in the folk beliefs of the Balkans, had only recently been codified with the formation of Jugoslavija. For centuries after the Event, the states of the Balkans have suffered from wars and subjugation, just as they have many times before. In times like those, the disunited Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim peasants were briefly united in prayer towards a single mythical, shining hero - Marshal Tito. Ancient folk tales speak of the Prophet-Marshal, how he was directed by God himself to unite the squabbling tribes of the Balkans, and teach them the ways of Brotherhood and Unity. With the help of his great generals Jelachich and Karadjordje, Marshal Tito wrestled the vast plains of Pannonia from the tyrannical Ugars and the rolling hills of Raška from the hordes of Osman, and founded the first true Empire of Jugoslavija on the crossroads of Europe, guided by the principles of Brotherhood and Unity. The rebelling of the Yugoslavs against the hordes of Makedon, just as they have done many times before, has led to the codification of the many myths of Marshal Tito's heroism This led to the creation of a new holy book, one that reduces the roles of Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad, and replaces them with the Prophet-Marshal as the true Messiah and the Seal of the Prophets, much to the chagrin of the people of Jugoslavija, who consider it a politicised perversion of their ancient faiths.;;;;;;;;;x

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist_DESC;Katerinist belief states that the Great Holy Spirit and Mother Russia are two equal aspects of the divine energy of the universe, one being masculine and the other feminine. They believe that while the Spirit created the world, Mother Russia created man, and in Her own image gave women the divine power of birth and motherly love. As such, they hold that, just as man is born from a woman, so too were great Russia, its golden age and its glory born from Catherine the Great, the Divine Mother. Katerinists claim that, while every Tsar is blessed by the Spirit, only the Tsarina-Mother was truly divine, and perfect evidence that women are the natural leaders of mankind. Contemporary Tsarists, however, do not believe that Mother Russia is a literal deity, believing the name to merely be a metaphor for the Great Holy Spirit.;;;;;;;;;x

Now, they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x

Requiring strict discipline of their followers and of the priests they recreated their bishoprics across the major kingdoms, which in turn flowed into the militaries and economies of the enterprising rulers.

laestadian;Laestadian;;;;;;;;;x
laestadian_DESC;Laestadianism is a pietistic movement within Lutheranism founded by pre-Event preacher Lars Levi Laestadius. Pietism places especial focus on individual piety and virtue, with Laestadianism advocating for a sinless, spiritual life, free from worldly vices and material greed. Simplicity and worldlessness are important in the every day life of Laestadians, with vanity being frowned upon, as a lavish lifestyle is considered sinful, as well as drinking, dancing, and bodily modifications. If knowingly sinned, a faithful believer should confess to another believer, so that his sins may be forgiven in Jesus' name and blood.;;;;;;;;;x

vagarna_DESC;The Church of Enchanted Beings, named after the concept of "väsen", claims to be the successors of millennia old traditions of the European North. Though functionally Christian, centuries of distortion have rendered them a completely separate religion. Emphasis on oral traditions and folk stories have pushed its Biblical aspects into less and less importance, while belief in the supernatural and the hidden has become key parts of everyday life. The unifying part of this folklore is belief in hidden magical creatures, such as gnomes, trolls, and elemental spirits. Protector spirits and patron deities are also frequent and vary from region to region, of note is the presence of several severely distorted Aesir amongst the regional mythologies.;;;;;;;;;x

gnostic_DESC;The Einblicker, or the "Insightful", are an esoteric movement that believes they hold the true history of the world. They adhere strongly to the god Adonis, who was created by Monad long before the age of man alongside his consort Dido. However, Adonis was killed and defeated by his brother Moloch, who sent unto the Earth many plagues and a Great Flood, and revealed himself to false prophets, masquerading as the true god. Under the guise of the One, Moloch demonised Adonis as the Devil, and through the faith of his followers kept control over the Earth for millennia. However, Adonis spent ages regaining his strength until finally retaking control of the Earth and defeating Moloch once and for all. In preparation for the great cataclysm to ensue, Adonis revealed himself to the true mystics and prophets of the world, such as Hermes Trismegistus and Christian Rosenkreuz - considered the Fathers of the Einblickers.\nThough the war in heaven caused great destruction on Earth, known to many as the Event, the true faith endured, its most faithful adherents now being delvers into what they consider the true nature of Monad and Adonis. They live without without strict moral code, believing the pleasures of life are gifts from Adonai and to suppress it is to succumb to Moloch's influence. The Einblickers especially revile what they consider the false churches of old, who still cling to the whims of Moloch, and aim to oppress the true faith. Thus, they seek to emulate the great hero Luther, who walked in the path of Hermann and fought to banish the forces of the Devil-Pope from the woods of the Teutons.;;;;;;;;;x

Its congregation exists as a loose union of churches formed from the remnants of these ancient missionary activities. Despite the influences, Eastern Protestantism still maintains Orthodox traditions since its inception, and are preformed in the Byzantine Rite. Its adherents also share many commonalities Syriac and Chaldean Churches, which include religious calendars, festivals, and reverence of saints.

malikite_DESC;The Sharifi school of thought is a sect of Islam from the Maghreb which has developed some heterodox beliefs, especially regarding who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Sharifi of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

Namely, the Mesopotamians revere figures such as Ishtar and Ea, whom they consider to be karubiyin loyal to Allah. They believe that these archangels, now carved into millennia old stones, guided old Mesopotamians before Islam. Under their guidance, the ancient Mesopotamians founded the Empire of Mesopotamia, which ruled the orient for millennia as the one true domain of Allah, until they were shattered by Iblis as revenge for being cast from heaven. The Mesopotamians now believe it is their destiny to restore the ancient empire as the one true ummah and usher in a new golden age.;;;;;;;;;x

tengri_pagan_DESC;Tengrism is the ancient traditional religion of the steppe people of Eurasia and the many people of Siberia, including various Turkic and Mongolic groups.

novelist_DESC;One of many post-Event religions originating in France, the Novelist faith believes that the truth of the origin of the world and all life is not contained in a single book, but is fragmented among many of the books that humanity produced. The Novel, the magnum opus penned by the author-god Eru and brought to Earth by the Valar at the beginning of time, is divided into various great ages and was, is, and will be revealed to the faithful across time. Novelists trace their founding to the reign of Charlemagne, the first ruler of Númenor and all of mankind during the First Age of Men. The line of Charlemagne, however, lies shattered - the loss of the legendary sword Durendal during the great Quest of the Third Age led to the deluge known as the Event. This calamity was the greatest that men had ever seen, leading to the loss of magic, the fall of empires, and uncountable deaths. Thus, they find themselves in the Fifth Age of Men, and the great line of Charlemagne still lives. Novelists believe that men of other nations still cling to the previous age, adorning the crowns and flags of realms that were burned to ash during the Event - a mistake that should be corrected in time for the great coming Quest of the current era.

Their gallant knights, a spiritual caste of rulers and warriors meant to ascend to Charlemagne's army in the heavens, train all their lives for the great task ahead of them, for only a virtuous and skilled knight is fit to fight the great evil next to their Taxiarch.

novelist_reformed_DESC;One of many post-Event religions originating in France, the Novelist faith believes that the truth of the origin of the world and all life is not contained in a single book, but is fragmented among many of the books that humanity produced. The Novel, the magnum opus penned by the author-god Eru and brought to Earth by the Valar at the beginning of time, is divided into various great ages and was, is, and will be revealed to the faithful across time. Novelists trace their founding to the reign of Charlemagne, the first ruler of Númenor and all of mankind during the First Age of Men. The line of Charlemagne, however, lies shattered - the loss of the legendary sword Durendal during the great Quest of the Third Age led to the great deluge known as the Event. This calamity was the greatest that men had ever seen, leading to the loss of magic, the fall of empires, and uncountable deaths. Thus, they find themselves in the Fifth Age of Men, and the great line of Charlemagne still lives. Novelists believe that men of other nations still cling to the previous age, adorning the crowns and flags of realms that were burned to ash during the Event - a mistake that should be corrected in time for the great coming Quest of the current era. The Novelists hope to restore the fragments of Durendal, the legendary sword of change destined to defeat the great evil and bring forth the next age, and prevent it from mirroring the great calamity of the previous. Their gallant knights, a spiritual caste of rulers and warriors meant to ascend to Charlemagne's army in the heavens, train all their lives for the great task ahead of them, for only a virtuous and skilled knight is fit to fight the great evil next to their Taxiarch. Through endless trials and tribulations, the people of the book have survived even the disastrous fall of Númenor, and reformed and reorganised their faith, compiling all known pieces of the Novel into a single grand compendium of books. The gallant knights of the occident now stand at the forefront of this New World, ready to quest forth in the name of Charlemagne and his great knights of yore.;;;;;;;;;;x

oldbeliever_DESC;The Old Believers trace their founding to an event called the Raskol, long before the Deluge. They maintain that the corrupt Patriach Nikon caused the Raskol by calling for mass reform of the Church, a deed that only could have been commanded by Satan himself. As a result of Nikon's perversions, the Russian Orthodox Church was split into two - the Old Believer churches of the faithful, and the degenerate main Church that eventually devolved into Tsarism, a stain in the eyes of the Lord. The first Old Believers escaped into the remote and inhospitable wilderness of Russia, and when the Earth was destroyed by God, they persisted and reorganised. Now they are formally united in one true Russian Orthodox Church led by the First Hierarch, an elevated priest with limited authority so as to never again cause another Raskol.;;;;;;;;;x

However, thanks to the Transnistrian Empire, not all hope is lost for the faith that once held together many great Empires.;;;;;;;;;x

sevillian_DESC;In the final days before the event, the Archangel Raphael sent a vision to a man now known as a great Saint to the Sevillians. It showed him that Rome had become corrupt once more and that the Vicar of Christ should no longer be seated in that wretched city, instead demanding it should be seated in the righteous city of Seville, and if this did not occur a great calamity would befall the world. He attempted to warn the church of the vision, who refused to place their faith in him. In preparation for the oncoming calamity he sought to gather as many followers as possible and establish a new church in the world which would come after, becoming the first Sevillian Pope. When he revealed to the people of Spain that it was the Papacy who had led them to the apocalypse, many of the most fundamentalist Catholics who in the years before the event had grown tired with the growing progressivism of the church flocked to this new church's banners after the event, believing it to better represent the church of old. With all of Spain now following the Sevillian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x

petrist_DESC;Unlike mainstream Tsarism, Petrism states that there are no more Tsars to be blessed in this world. Petrists claim that the unbroken line of Tsars ended with the death of the almighty Peter the Great, Tsar of Man. Petrists adamantly believe that all Tsars after Peter were nothing but imposters, with their degeneracy in life a clear display of falsehood. Tsar Nicholas was a weak and incompetent man, deceived by the demon Rasputin and ultimately killed and consumed by the wicked Lord Stalin, the personification of all evil. The death of Tsar Peter was the death of Mother Russia, with the events that followed culminating in the death of the world itself. Thus, the most important belief of the Petrists is that the apotheosis of Tsar Peter was the last, and will be the last once Peter returns to Earth in flesh to gather the faithful and bring forth a new Great Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

Germania, guided by a Kanzler, was one of these civilisations, showing her many faces through the ages, being there to calm her people, giving them freedom like no other, and providing for their needs. But the Devil decieved Germania, giving her delusions of grandeur and a right to rule over the world, and made her unleash her wrath on earth, causing the Event. For this Heimwehist believe they must pay penance for God, to feel the pain the peoples of old felt, preach for peace among everyone, and rid themselves of sin, for one must be a Kanzler of themselves before they can be a Kanzler of Germania.;;;;;;;;;x

The Mikraists instead believe that the primacy of the older generations of Rabbis cannot be challenged by the current generation of thinkers and thus no contradictions are allowed to arise. The Mikraists seek to find the legendary Mashiach ben Yosef, who they believe is hidden among pious Jews, awaiting to be found and lead the Jewish people to the Messianic Age by cleansing the Land of Israel from evil forces and rebuild a proper Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;x

The Guru Granth Sahib speaks of one society unified under One God, where all men are free and love each other regardless of their beliefs. Until then, however, the Sikhs do their best to live by their faith with the utmost discipline. The Guru Granth Sahib speaks of the Five Ks that a Sikh must always carry, and the Four Prohibitions that a Sikh must always avoid, and all Sikh societies must follow the Three Pillars as laid down by Guru Nanak. Even the most zealous of heathens hold respect for the Sikh, their temples always being open regardless of faith, and their charities rivalling even the richest kingdoms in their reach.;;;;;;;;;x

After the defeat of the Tsar at the hands of the revolution, Lenin sought to return his body and divine essence to the Great Holy Spirit only for him to be struck down by Stalin and Trotsky, who wished to steal the Tsar's power for themselves. Stalin kept Trotsky at bay long enough to steal the Tsar's power all for himself, ascending to godhood. The Holy Spirit was enraged at this turn of events and told Stalin that one day, Lenin would reincarnate among the Russian people to destroy him and his followers. Only then under the rule of the Leninov would Russia become a land of peace and prosperity once again.;;;;;;;;;x

stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the only Tsar worthy of worship as he earned his divinity through his own deeds. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on due to legends that portray Tsar Stalin as having usurped his power from Nicholas the Martyr by killing him with the help of Lenin and Trotsky and consuming his essence, as such the Stalinists were driven away by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and loyalty can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many enemies including the Great Holy Spirit who wishes to bring ruin to all Stalinist realms for Lord Stalin's usurpation. They also believe that similar to their lord they may become divine like a Tsar by consuming the essence of one. Stalin is believed to have been betrayed following his ascension by one of his followers, this traitor attempted to consume Stalin as Stalin had consumed Nicholas. He survived this assault on his being, but was so distraught by it that he saw traitors everywhere and used his divine powers to purge them. It is still debated to this day who this traitor was exactly.;;;;;;;;;x

Thus, the Queen was granted eternal dominion over the summer, and the knight became the King of Winter. Their subjects on earth were free to revel under their protection, enjoying celebrations of morris dancing, maypoles, the burning of wicker men, and vast amounts of cider. The Summer Queen grants her followers health and prosperity, while the Winter King protects his subjects from invaders and evil fae using the legendary sword Excalibur, emanations of which are said to still be found in the natural world.;;;;;;;;;x

barelvi_DESC;The Barelvi strand of Sunni Islam has been the largest Muslim force in southern Asia for centuries, even before the old world was struck down. A Sufi revivalist movement, the Barelvi traditionally believe in the light of Muhammad, the belief that the Prophet was one of Allah's first creations, and now exists as light to spread God's knowledge and intercede on the behalf of Muslims. Barelvi rituals include the chanting of dhikr, and the veneration of Muslim saints. Sufi Tariqahs such as the Qadiri, Chishti and Naqshbandi orders are also very popular. With the Muslims of Bangladesh largely turning to syncretism, the Barelvi movement has effectively been reduced to the lands traditionally considered to be Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;x

Despite that, Deobandism is not fundamentally opposed to sufism, believing that it is a fundamental part of Islam and that more esoteric practices like dhikr and Mawlid should be avoided. The Deobandi movement has been greatly influenced by the Wahhabist and Salafist movements to the point where Deobandist rulers traditionally use a form of stratocracy - the ghazwa.;;;;;;;;;x

theosophy_DESC;Theosophists are the followers of the Ascended Masters, beings that shepherd the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. Theosophy was merely one of many foreign esoteric religions to gain a foothold in the British Isles following the Event and the subsequent collapse of the Church. Nonetheless, it was eventually largely stomped out by Thelemites and their Queen. According to Theosophist teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of the Ascended Masters that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth relying more and more upon false religions before the Old World collapsed under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends hold that a Lord Maitreya will emerge to transfer knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Theosophists de-emphasise the importance of organized religious scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth. Additionally, Theosophy in the British Isles holds large amounts of influence from the Thelema faith, viewing the Queen as an ascended master in her own right.;;;;;;;;;x

Saint Germain is considered responsible for the founding of many civilisations and movements throughout history, including his incarnations as the god-king of the Golden Empire in the Sahara desert, the High Priest of Atlantis, the prophet Samuel, Saint Joseph, the explorer Columbus, and the philosopher Bacon. Following the Event with the heralding of the Aquarian Age his role as the Lord of Civilisation meant he became the main divine force alongside Sanat Kumara responsible for the rebuilding of civilisation and the retrieval of the God flame back into humanity's grasp.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_sanat_kunara_desc;This character is channeling Sanat Kumara, a powerful cosmic being, the Guru of Christ, hierarch of Venus and one of the seven holy Kumaras, said to be the former Lord of the World and the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, the fraternity of Ascended Masters across the world. Theosophists believe that following the Event he stepped down as the Lord with Saint Germain, the Lord of Civilisation taking his place, tasked with bringing the God flame back to humanity, and instead is dedicated to setting his believers on the path of the ruby ray from his domain in the mythical city of Shamballa.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_lady_master_venus_desc;This character is channeling Lady Master Venus, said to be the Divine Complement and Twin Flame to Sanat Kumara. Mankind is said to be her evolution, and she herself came to Earth following the Event to bring the holy flames of civilisation back to humanity. Some Theosophists also consider her to be a goddess of love.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_jesus_desc;This character is channeling Jesus Christ, the avatar of the Age of Pisces, the Messiah and the incarnation of the Word. During the Piscean age, he revealed the Christ Self to humanity to show the works of the God presence to each human soul. Theosophists believe that following his resurrection, Jesus travelled to Kashmir, where he ascended to the theric city of Shamballa. Following the Event, the Christ consciousness had been lost to many, leading to people turning away from his teachings en masse. Veneration of Jesus is seen with suspicion by the Thelemites, who consider him to be nothing more than an arrogant mystic.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_the_queen_desc;This character is channeling Our Lady of the Stars, the highest Thelemite deity, considered a Master of Ancient Wisdom in Theosophist belief. Following the Event, the Queen ascended to become a Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, called the Aeon of Ma'at in Thelema, ruling the cosmos while Saint Germain rules the earthly domain.

thelemic_DESC;The Old Thelema faith was mostly abandoned centuries ago by most inhabitants of the British Empire in favour of the current Thelema faith. Old Thelemites claim to be practising their faith as originally dictated by the prophet Crowley. They reject the position of the Lord Protectors as regents of the Queen, considering mainstream Thelemite beliefs to be a perversion of the goddess Nuit. Old Thelemites do not believe Nuit is to return to Earth to rule Britannia, and instead consider the British Empire to be a theologically oppressive state, hellbent on spreading their faith and state to all corners of the Earth, making them no different than the Church. This stance was cause for a massive civil war in Britain in the 23rd century, which led to their marginalisation from society. As such, Old Thelemites only persist in the fringes of Britain, and instead focus their practice on the personal will of the individual, acting to discover their True Will.;;;;;;;;;x

thelemic_reformed_DESC;The Thelema faith was founded by the great prophet Aleister Crowley long before the Event. With the creation of the new religion, Crowley heralded the new Aeon of Horus, and declared the main principle of Thelema: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." The Thelemite faith is centered around a pantheon of deities, the main of which is the all-knowing and omnipresent Queen of Britannia - Victoria Gloriana. The Queen rules over the cosmos and is the source of all energy and matter in our world. The central scripture became The Book of the Law, a holy text Crowley claimed to be revealed to him by Aiwass, an entity he considered his guardian angel and which modern Thelemites consider to be a manifestation of the Queen. Before the Event, the Thelemite faithful were ruthlessly pursued by the followers of Jesus on accusations of devil worship, being thrown into obscurity. After the deluge, however, Thelema experienced a massive resurgence in Britain, and a series of civil wars confirmed the supremacy of Royal Thelemic Lodges and the one true Queen, Victoria Gloriana. With the Queen soon declaring the first Lord Protectors of Britannia to rule the material world in her stead, the beginning of a new aeon was heralded - the Aeon of Ma'at, securing Britannia's eternal dominion over the waves.;;;;;;;;;x

Walking in their footsteps, Arcane mages are avid practitioners and students of all types of magick, having earned themselves a reputation all throughout the British Isles for their unwavering dedication to the Craft. Compared to other schools and traditions of magick study, the Arcane Covens are particular for their rigid ritual structure, having many explicitly defined and organised rituals, serving to hone one's knowledge and power over time. They worship a wide variety of gods and goddesses, each considered different aspects of either the Horned Lord or the Lady in the Moon, though in the years since the Event many of their Covens have been driven underground by the emerging Royal Thelemites.

congregationist_DESC;Being the largest remaining Jewish community in Europe and the de-facto leaders of the continent's Jewry has made the United Synagogue of Britain one of the most influential institutions in Old World Judaism. Just like Britain of old, the Empire of Britannia has decided to continue recognizing the United Synagogue as an authority in Judaism and has promoted it as an umbrella organization for the myriad Jewish sects dotting Britain. Since then, the United Synagogue has integrated Sephardic congregations and has promoted a more secular lifestyle while keeping with orthodox Jewish traditions. The farthest sects falling under this umbrella are to be found in Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

federationist_DESC;Appealing to the Yiddish speaking masses in the lower classes of British society during the last centuries before the Event, the Federation of Synagogues is a rival institution to the United Synagogue.

titoist_DESC;An obscure sect of Stalinism, Titoism holds that the follower who betrayed lord Stalin was the legendary ruler of Yugoslavia Tito. They believe that Tito betrayed Stalin in order to take the power he had stolen and utilise it to free his homeland from the rule of a despotic and malevolent Car. Titoists believe that Stalin did not survive the attempt on his life made by Tito and that Tito went on to free his homeland from the Tyranny of its old Car whom the great Holy spirit refused to strike down itself. Soon after he freed his people the Great holy spirit did battle with him in a great war for heaven, this was for having assisted in the murder of one of its appointed rulers and directly murdering another. This great heavenly war was the event and since that time Tito has been imprisoned in hell by the great holy spirit as he cannot be entirely destroyed given that he contains a fraction of the spirits own power. Only through devotion and loyalty from his small sect can Tito be freed and rule on earth once again.;;;;;;;;;x

trotskyite_DESC;A small offshoot of mainstream Stalinism, Trotskyists believe that Lord Stalin was in fact a traitor to Russia, and that Trotsky, an obscure figure in the Stalinist faith was his betrayer. He is believed to have betrayed Stalin because Stalin was abusing his divine powers, bringing ruin to Russia. Trotsky tried to reason with Stalin, that his power should be turned outward to the other rulers appointed by the Holy Spirit and that they should be overthrown. Stalin would not listen and it is additionally believed by the faith that Stalin was not originally meant to be the consumer of Nicholas when their group plotted his downfall. So Trotsky and others plotted the downfall of what they saw as another weak Tsar. Trotsky managed to consume part of Stalin in his attack, reducing Stalin's power significantly and conversely increasing the power of Trotsky. The two continued to battle continuously despite the damage done to the world, the peak of this being the event itself, yet until all Tsarists and Stalinists are destroyed and only Trotskyists remain, there can be no peace.;;;;;;;;;x

transatlantic_DESC;For years among merchants and sailors of different cultures and languages stories have been told about the distant lands of Mexico far beyond the Atlantic Ocean, where there is a religious leader protected by the archangel Raphael himself who rules the majority of Catholics from a city located on an island within a great lake. These stories have caused a fraction of Sevillians to come to the conclusion that this man is the true Pope and  that the Holy See was relocated again following the Event, such a revelation means that each and every one of the Christian Churches of the Old World is a vile heresy! As such, the Transatlantics declared themselves representatives of the Pope in Mexico and his council of cardinals, and decided to take it upon themselves to spread the word of the One True Pope.;;;;;;;;;x

cadaverist_DESC;Cadaverists are a small heretic sect that believe that one of the last Antediluvian Popes is not in fact dead, but can still miraculously speak to members of the higher Cadaverist clergy. It is said that the angel Gabriel came to him during the event and froze his mind within his body to preserve it, as a way to protect him from the calamity. They believe he will some day be restored to his pre-event form once the Cadaverist faithful make up all of the Christian faithful. It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep said corpse atop a golden recreation of the Holy See and insisting that it can communicate. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x

Moving in step with smaller movements in Najd, Africa, Northern India, and more, just before the event it became a unified movement until the moniker of Salafiya. The name comes from the salaf, the first three generations of Muslims, which is believed to be the unadulterated and pure form of Islam. The Salafis believe that Sunnis should rely on the Quran and the Sunnah alone, while also rejecting any other branch or school of Islam as heretics or even non-Muslims.;;;;;;;;;x

zarist_DESC;Claiming to originate long before the Event, Tsarism is a religion that holds the world was created by a powerful god, the Great Holy Spirit. Though he created the first man, his children were deceived by demons and imposters, and abandoned him. Thus, the Lord bestows his grace and favour to a single temporal ruler, a prophet in flesh - a Tsar. Tsarists hold that the Tsar is blessed by the Lord with heavenly powers, commands the full obedience of his people and, after death, is taken to Heaven to be deified, where they continue to watch over the mortal world from beyond. Tsarists express their piety by praying to the Tsars of yore and going on pilgrimages to their burial sites, while the closest servants of the main Tsars are worshipped as saints, being personally guided by the blessed. Though Tsars are imbued with the Holy Spirit, they are not infallible, and there isn't a more telling example than the story of Lord Stalin, a Tsar who earned his powers by consuming the heart and blood of another, Tsar Nicholas the Martyr, for which he was banished from Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

The religion holds that by following the way of non-violence or 'ahimsa', humans can achieve liberation from the endless cycle of torment and reincarnation, as well as omnipotence, omniscience, and infinite bliss. Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority. That changed in the post-Event world, where a new order of monks, called the Neeraji, vigorously proselytise for the faith, resulting in a great resurgence of Jainism throughout India.;;;;;;;;;x

He is the twin brother of Athena, following his rebirth from Zeus' body he convinced many of his younger relatives to rise against Zeus and overthrow him. Ares and Athena were quick to join Anaxorgos, having given him great favour in life as preparation for this battle. When Poseidon took to his brother's defence it was his son Triton, with the aid of his ship and trusty Nereid attendant Averof, who entered battle against the ancient god of the sea and imprisoned him. Persephone convinced Hades to not partake in this familial battle and so he was spared by Anaxorgos due to the aid rendered by Persephone and her Brother Philomelus. It was this great battle between the younger Olympians and those of the older generation which was the event, and said event is evidence of his cousins, siblings and his own destructive power. He now wishes to reclaim his old empire and expand it to encompass the world. The conquest was only halted by the formation of Yugoslavia, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;x

It placed the emphasis on the goal of spreading the word of Buddha by violence and coercion over traditional pacifism.

Just like how the Kali-Yuga struck Siam, many disasters have befallen their homeland. The greedy and wicked rose in power and the devoted persecuted. Despite that, many believed that Sri Ariya Meitrai, a Messianic incarnation of Lord Buddha, will come to their aid when the time is right. As such, they held out steadfastly, praying that one day humanity shall be set free from suffering.;;;;;;;;;x

Hoping to preserve Turkic Muslim identity in the face of post-deluge chaos and isolation from the greater ummah, they encourage the practice of ijtihad, the independent and continued interpreting of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Viewing the post-Event world as a dark age for Islam, the Jadidiyya turn to the works of Old World jadids such as Gasprinsky and Rasulev for guidance, seeking to usher forth a new era of modern, progressive Turkic Islam, free from the paganism and decadence that mark the world scarred by the Event.;;;;;;;;;x

Created before the Event by a man named Tella Tella, the Krisilaamic holy book, the Iweifeoluwa, merges the core values of the Bible and the Qur'an into five main principles of the religion - love, mercy, joy, good deeds, and truth. The Krisilaamic holy creed states that the God of Muhammad is One, the God of Jesus is One, and Humanity is One.;;;;;;;;;x

Unwilling to accept such outlandish news, the Primate of Lagos declared himself as the head of the faith until contact with the Crown could be made again. After the fall of the Enwezor dynasty, Episcopalians refused to accept the new Yoruba led Oke-Tude faith and remained steadfast against conversion. For the faithful outside of Nigeria, the Primate can designate pious and powerful rulers as Protectors of the Faith, who serves as the de facto religious head.;;;;;;;;;x

Now, Temirizm followers seek the forgiveness of Bolat Alla by religiously thanking Him every time they use metal, be it for minor actions, for war or for the construction of their famed war chariots. The Temiri faith religiously protects the surviving Aral Lakes, in hopes of one day restoring the glory of al-Jannah. The faith also revers a number of other spirits and angels that are said to represent the might and glory of mankind and the Greatest. Among those are the siblings spirits of war - Kalashnikov, Katyusha and Gvozdika, the spirit of fertility and nature Tselina, and the kingfisher spirit that guards workers and scavengers, Zimiran.

Traditionally, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England is the British monarch, with the de facto leader of the Anglican Communion being the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, the Event saw to it that both vanished from the face of the Earth - the collapse of Old Britain led to the collapse of the Church. The conquests of Arthur Crowtemple marked the disappearance of the last Archbishop, and the Anglicans were left with nobody to guide them. Soon, the rise of Thelema as the new state religion of Britain led to Anglicanism being perceived as little more than a footnote in history. That being said, a faith is never truly dead as long as someone believes in it, and so it is not impossible for the Church of England to return to its former glory.;;;;;;;;;x

As a goal, the Utraquists seek to create their own domain, and are eager to spread their beliefs far and wide.;;;;;;;;;x

zaydi;Zaydi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;Zaidiyyah, occasionally known as Fiver Shias, is one of the Shia sects closest in terms of theology to the Ibadi and Mutazila schools. Zaidiyyah emerged in the eighth century from Shi'a Islam. Zaidis are named after Zayd ibn Ali, the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali and the son of the fourth Imam Ali ibn 'Husain. Following the event it has attempted to consolidate its position in Yemen in an effort to protect itself during this era of tribulation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Ismaili;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;The Ismaili Shi'ites are those who accept Isma'il ibn Jafar as the legitimate successor to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, unlike the mainstream Twelver Shias, who accept his younger brother Musa al-Kadhim. Historically, the Ismailis reached the peak of their political power in the age long before the Event, with the Fatimid Caliphate. However, in the intervening centuries, they have dwindled somewhat, being further subdivided into sects. In the chaos of the Event, many Ismaili sects have been absorbed by others, and now most Ismailis accept the Aga Khan as their lord. Theologically, Ismailis tend to be more focused on the interior, mystical elements of Islam than are Twelvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Originating in the split between those who supported Ali as the successor to Muhammad and those who supported Abu Bakr, Shia Islam is the second largest grouping of Muslims in the world. The overwhelmingly dominant school of Shia thought is the Jafari, or "Twelver" school, holding that there exist Twelve divinely-ordained Imams, with the Twelfth and final Imam having been divinely hidden from the world since the tenth century, and who will return as the promised Mahdi at the end of time. Nowadays, unlike the Sunnis, there is no unifying Caliph figure among Shia Muslims, so they follow the guidance of powerful and influential Imams of major realms.;;;;;;;;;;x

However, the recent fall of Lithuania to infidels has disgusted many of the zealous locals, who have banded together in an attempt to defend the faith. The new group calls itself 'The Purifiers' as a reference to Paulius Juze's nickname, "Purifier of Lithuania", and promise to fight unbelief everywhere, but especially in Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;x

Yarsani believe in the reincarnation of the soul, but also of God, and that in each Epoch there are seven Haftan who accompany God on earth in mortal form. The Last Major presence of God on Earth was Soltan Sahak, who is said to have been born from his virgin mother, and when he grew of age he instructed the Kurdish tribes in the dogma of Yarsan. With the collapse of the world order, the Yarsani have declared it to be the fifth epoch, no longer bound to their mountain lands they strike forth in their search for the next incarnation of God.;;;;;;;;;x

The group is believed to have been founded by Ibn Nusayr during the 9th century. Ibn Nusayr was a disciple of the tenth Twelver Imam, Ali al-Hadi and of the eleventh Twelver Imam, Hasan al-Askari. For this reason, Alawites are also called Nusayris. Another name, Ansari, is believed to be a mistransliteration of "Nusayri". In game they are represented as a Druze heresy due to the similarities between the two religions.;;;;;;;;;x

The övlat act as royalty, court shamans, clerics, diplomats, and valuable advisors. Being member of an övlat tribe is immensely prestigious, and they are even reported to have supernatural powers. Other than sufism, the Övlati Muslims also put great value in their ancestral mythology, with archaic epics being retold by wandering dervishes, creation myths written down in books as long as the Qur'an itself, and the wolf being considered a holy creature.;;;;;;;;;x

sisukkuus_DESC;The concept of "sisu" has always been integral to life in Finland. Outsiders consider them nothing more than a disciplined people, but to Finns that discipline is just one of many things necessary to attain good sisu. Sisu is a life force that is innate to all living beings, and it forms a scale with a fragile balance. On one end, bad sisu will make a man corrupted and infirm, while good sisu will give that same man inhuman strength and combat prowess. Upon death, one's sisu will determine whether they ascend to Ylijumala's realm as a deity themselves, or fall into manala and be cursed to suffer for eternity. As an example, Sisuists believe that the Marshal was able to defend Finland against invaders for decades without losing vigor thanks to his good standing in life, while the wicked Lord Stalin was turned into a frail madman as a result of stealing divinity, becoming a cursed god worshipped only by the insane.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;

apostolic_DESC;The "Igreja Romariana", or "Romarian Church" is the legal successor to the Catholic church of Brazil. After the chaos of the Event, many Brazilians abandoned the Church, believing that Rome is gone, and with it the Pope. A small, but dedicated number of Sedevacantist Catholics held out, believing the Pope was simply too far to contact. Centuries passed, and the Romarian Church became the dominant Christian faith in most of Brazil, having absorbed many schismatic churches that rejected the Pope in Rome. It only grew to widespread prominence when the kings of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Espírito Santo and the dukes of Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe agreed to adopt it as part of their temporary alliance. By 2555, contact with Rome has been reestablished, and the Patriarch of Aparecida sits as the formal head of Brazilian Catholicism as contacting the Pope in Rome requires a perilous journey across the Atlantic. All adherents east of the Atlantic Ocean answer to the Archbishop of Cabo Verde, who in turn serves as the intermediary between the Pope and the Patriarch. Romarians reject the Sevillian Pope, believing him to be yet another schismatic like the ones that were struck  down in Brazil many years before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

espiritista_DESC;Spiritism, also called Kardecism, is a religious movement founded by the great pre-Event mystic Kardec, who sought to explain the fate of the soul after the death of the mortal body. Contrary to all Christian thinkers before him, he claimed the soul does not immediately leave the Earth, but reincarnates back into material existence. Spiritists still believe their beliefs are Christian, though they frequently clash with official Church doctrine, due to some Spiritist sects rejecting the Holy Trinity and martyrdom of Jesus. Over time, it grew to influence all aspects of Brazilian religious life, even finding its way over the Atlantic Ocean. While most Spiritist religious movements were driven out of the limelight by the Romarian inquisitions, its influence still persists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sebastianist_DESC;Old world legends say that Portugal was ruled by a mighty King called Sebastian I. However, not long after his ascension, the King was called to war by Heaven, his duty being to save the world from evil. The King was then felled in battle, his body never to be found. While most dismiss this tale as being just that, an old legend, the Sebastianist faithful claim that King Sebastian was not killed, but ascended to Heaven to fulfil his role as the Son of God, the prophesied Messiah meant to return to the world in its greatest hour of need, on a foggy day. He will take up Portugal's throne once more, and bring forth the Quinto Império, the next kingdom of God on Earth.;;;;;;;;;x

cruzadista_DESC;Crusadism is a movement within the Romarian Catholic Church that sprung up not long after the Event. Initially claiming to represent the traditionalist parts of the Church, it eventually grew more and more radical, being excommunicated by the Patriarch of Aparecida in the year 2180. Whatever official Church support the movement had collapsed on that day, and its loudest supporters mostly retreated into the shadows. Then the first contact with Rome came, and with it came the knowledge of the state of the Holy See. The Catholic Church split in two, with its "legitimate" successor holding on to barely more than Italy, and practising all sorts of heresy the real Church would never support, like the marriage of priests. Thus, the remaining Crusadists of the New World elected their own Patriarch, one in communion with the true successor of Saint Peter, the Pope in Seville.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shindo_DESC;Korean shamanism, also known as Shindo, Mushindo or Muism, is the ancient animistic folk religion of Korea. It is said that in the years before the Event, a great War in Heaven took place between the Tyrannical Ruby Chairman and a mighty Dragon King, the culmination of which led to the near end of the world and the subsequent release of incredible amounts of spirits and energy into the world. Over time, this led to a large rise in the number of followers of shamanism in Korea, who now consider their task to be understanding and appeasing the many spirits released into the world. Korean folk beliefs include a wide variety of gods, spirits and supernatural beings, and shamans, known as mu, have an important role in their society. Shamans are chosen through a process known as shinbyeong, which the Shindo believe to be possession by a god and subsequent loss of self. Korean mythology largely differs from area to area, being mainly orally retold in the form of shamanic narratives and creation myths in rites known as gut, along with offerings to gods and spirits and rituals of song and dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinko_DESC;The Ryukyuan folk religion, also known as Shinko or Ryukyu Shinto, is the ancestral belief system of the Ryukyu islands, consisting of many deities, spirits and mythological creatures. Syncretic in nature, the Ryukyuan religion has over the centuries been influenced by a variety of religions, mainly Buddhism and traditional Chinese faiths like Taoism and Confucianism. The Shinko believe in the existence of mabui, a form of spirit or soul integral to every person, being their very essence and defining characteristic. At the center of Shinko worship are their Ultimate Ancestors, those being Utin (the father), Jiichi (the mother), and Ryugu (the sea), as family and reverence of ancestors are highly emphasised in Ryukyuan religion. Though not explicitly shamanistic, mediums and healers known as the kaminchu have an important role in their faith. Especially important are the female kaminchu, known as the noro, who formally act as priestesses and caretakers of Shinko temples, at times even acting as important political figures or priestess-queens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinto_DESC;Shinto is the main faith of Japan. This polytheistic faith revolves around Kami, spiritual entities that exist in all things. The various Kami are revered in shrines and the most important ones have extensive temples built for them. Shinto priests, called kannushi, celebrate Kami with kagura dances and seasonal festivals, ensuring their continued protection over their land. While all Kami receive some form of reverence, even if only in the form of small shrines, it is undeniable that certain Kami, such as Amaterasu or Ebisu, are more revered. After the Event, the role of Yokai, monstrous spirits, has grown into Shinto, the spirits becoming known as entities that are believed to hold negative influence over the world and thus opposed to the Kami. Divided into Mamono, Mononoke, Ayakashi and other groups, Yokai are greatly feared by Shinto followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bushinto_DESC;Western Shinto is a recent branch of Shinto that has developed through the influence of Amida Shinto over the Shinto practices of Shikoku and easter Chugoku. This faith places emphasis on the defense and unity of the Shinto followers of Japan, believing that, if Japan is unified and isolated, the Kami will celebrate this unity by bestowing their protection upon the land, granting bountiful harvests and health to the land, so long as its followers do not try to extend themselves upon other people. Western Shinto followers particularly fear the water spirits known as Ayakashi, and Seiryu, the eastern blue dragon that is said to have once punished Japan for its hubris and cruelty by destroying two of its greatest cities, and as contrast follow particularly Bishamonten and his companions, the Seven Gods of Fortune or Shichifukujin, and the gods that once shielded Japan from an invasion, Fujin and Raijin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They also seek to end the worship of the Kami, though would still support the Emperor if he were to bow to their righteous ways. Unlike the other sects of Japanese Buddhism, this sect was cast out of the fold for its overly violent means of attaining their goal, now being seen as heretical by the core Pure Land Buddhist sects.

caodai_DESC;Cao Ðài, full name Ðai Ðao Tam Ky Pho Ðo meaning The Great Faith for the Third Period of Redemption, is a syncretic movement born in Vietnam. Their beliefs draw from many different sources: ethical precepts from Confucianism, occult practices of Taoism, theories of karma and rebirth from Buddhism, and hierarchical organisation of Catholicism. The Cao Ðài believe that in the ancient antediluvian age, a man named Ngô Minh Chiêu was given a vision from the Divine Eye of God and was told to spread the faith far, as man will not find universal peace without one universal faith. They claim that many men have been given the will of the Highest Power throughout history, though their words have since been perverted by their followers. As a result, they revere many religious leaders, such as Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha, as saintly figures. In the days after the Event, however, the Cao Ðài have long struggled with persecution from Siam and Vietnam, and the Caodaist Church has since cut all ties with rulers of both empires and turned inwards in an act of self-preservation, though it remains to be seen if its followers would choose the Empire or their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In those days, the First Shifu, the first man to harness Qi, codified the Code of Xia, the rules and ideals all people shall abide from. The followers of the Wuxia faith believe that true enlightenment can only be achieved through following the path of the martial artist, seeking not to harm others but to right the wrongs of the world by bettering themselves, harnessing the flux of Qi within ones body and ultimately becoming enlightened. Practicioners of Wuxia divide themselves in various sects, such as the Shaolin, the Wudang and the Jeet Kune Do. The faith embraces the teachings of many ancient masters, such as the legendary Qitian Dasheng, the founder of the Shaolin Bodhidarma, and grand master Li Xiaolong, founder of Jeet Kune Do.

Hongxiejiao followers believe that any method is allowed to increase the power of the Heavenly Chairman, and rumors of their skills in assassination and scheming are widespread, though how much of it is true is hard to know.;;;;;;;;;x

Gidoggyo sects follow tenants of virtue and a rejection of 'sinfulness'.;;;;;;;;;x
