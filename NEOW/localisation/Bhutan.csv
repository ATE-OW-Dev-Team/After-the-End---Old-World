bhutanese_decayed_government;Stagnant Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;x
bhutanese_decayed_government_desc;This nation has done things the same way for so long that their traditions of governance have ossified, forming into an extremely rigid system that is incapable of responding quickly to any change. However, it is extremely efficient at responding to problems that it already understands, and will prove very stable - so long as it is never asked to govern any more land than it's used to.;;;;;;;;;x

bhutan_isolationist;Inward Perfectionist;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_isolationist_desc;This ruler believes that their realm should close itself off from external affairs and attend only to its internal affairs. They have much lower revolt risk and their realm is more likely to prosper. However, they cannot declare wars, except to make other nations into Tributaries.;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_open;Open To Trade;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_open_desc;This ruler is open to their nation having commerce with the outside world, provided that it is controlled and does not upset tradition overmuch. They may be willing to go to war, but will not annex land outside their traditional domain.;;;;;;;;;x ;;;;;;;;;
bhutan_expansionist;Belligerent Supremacist;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_expansionist_desc;This ruler believes that their superior society must use its military might to bring its enlightened rule over the lesser, barbaric societies beyond its walls. They have access to the normal range of casus belli, but their antiquated and ossified government is not well suited to governing the land they wish to conquer.;;;;;;;;;x
bhutanese_restored_government;Dragon Empire;;;;;;;;;x
bhutanese_restored_government_desc;This nation is highly advanced and ordered, with bureaucratic structures and technologies that preserve some of the marvels of the antediluvian world. However, despite being substantially reinvigorated, its structure is still somewhat rigid, limiting its ability to expand and govern new territory moreso than would an ordinary state. Nevertheless, it still has much greater ability to wage war than its decayed counterpart.;;;;;;;;;x

bhutan_diplo_reform;Reform the Imperial Parliament;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_diplo_reform_desc;Centuries of stability have turned the Imperial Parliament into little more than a useless talking-shop, whose members have more holidays than work days in the year. It desperately needs reforming, but only a highly persuasive Emperor could do so, and it would require a lot of capital, both political and monetary.;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_reformed_diplomacy;Reformed Imperial Parliament;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_martial_reform;Whip The Dragon Army Into Shape;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_martial_reform_desc;The Dragon Army hasn't had to fight a serious war in centuries, confining itself to minor skirmishes, border patrol, and occasional tributary wars against vastly inferior forces. It has become complacent, nepotism is rampant, and the position of officer is seen as a cushy job rather than a serious calling to sacrifice for one's country. It would take a skilled and forceful Emperor with a strong knowledge of military strategy to clean this mess up.;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_reformed_martial;Reinvigorated Army;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_stewardship_reform;Rationalise the Tax Laws;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_stewardship_reform_desc;Bhutan's tax laws are arcane and convoluted, as special exemptions have been granted over the years and never revoked, not to mention the fact that the system used for tax calculation is needlessly complicated. It would take an Emperor with a lot of political will and a fine administrative mind to sort this out.;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_reformed_stewardship;Rationalised Tax System;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_intrigue_reform;Overhaul The Imperial Secret Service;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_intrigue_reform_desc;With so little external threat, our spy network has grown inefficient, with powerful nobles co-opting much of it for use against their political rivals. This makes it much harder for us to ensure our spies are actually going where we need them to go. Only an Emperor with considerable experience in the subtle arts will be able to rub out this problem.;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_reformed_intrigue;Overhauled Secret Service;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_learning_reform;Break Up The Academy;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan_learning_reform_desc;The justified belief that our glorious ancestors have already discovered everything worth knowing has caused our academia to become hidebound, teaching only what has been widely accepted for centuries and crushing any new idea mercilessly. While a healthy reserve about new ideas is entirely correct, this attitude has been allowed to grow to an unhealthy extent. A wise and learned Emperor will be needed to restore order.;;;;;;;;;x

bhutan2Desc;No sooner have you ascended to the Throne than you step out upon the Lotus Pavilion, a great raised platform overlooking the streets of the capital. Below you, thousands of cheering subjects wait on your words, dragon banners flying overhead. You will have only one chance to make a first impression on the crowd, and the stance you take here will color the future of your entire reign. What will you speak of?;;;;;;;;;x

bhutan3Title;The Dragon Wakes;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan3Desc;Since time out of mind, the small mountain nation of Bhutan has reigned stable and steadfast, seemingly immune to the storms and tribulations of the world. Legends state that even the Event barely touched them, and that much of the wisdom of the Old World is preserved in the great Catacombs beneath Bumthang. To the people of Tibet and India, the Thunder Dragon Empire is simply like the ground beneath a man's feet - he rarely notices it, but he could not imagine it ceasing to exist. \nHowever, long centuries of peace had made the Bhutanese complacent. Their tax system grew inefficient, their scholars ceased to learn anything new, and their army grew rife with nepotism and laziness. That has all changed, however. Over the past few decades, the Emperors have gradually managed to reform their country's ageing systems, and now they have completed their work. With their country once again revitalised, the Thunder Dragon may yet again spread its wings across Eastern Asia...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_bhutan3;Glorious!;;;;;;;;;x

bhutan4Title;The Flourishing Lotus;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan4Desc;Without the distractions of war or the need to produce weapons for the maintenance of order, Bhutan's great industries have flourished, providing us with a great surplus of wealth. You could choose to reap the benefits of this immediately, or you could re-invest it into your own demesne.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_bhutan4;The treasury will benefit from this!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_bhutan4;Our land will become ever more prosperous!;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan5Title;The Dragon's Aching Joints;;;;;;;;;x
bhutan5Desc;Bhutan's bureaucratic system is highly efficient at administrating land - specifically, the land within Bhutan itself, which they've gotten so used to dealing with that it's often joked that the bureaucrats could do their jobs while asleep. Unfortunately, we've found ourselves in possession of land outside of those familiar schema, and they're having a bit of trouble with it. In fact, they are proving frankly incompetent at managing it, and have bungled it horribly. Now the peasants are angry, the taxes aren't being collected, and many within the Empire are starting to wonder if taking this land was worth it in the first place.;;;;;;;;;x
