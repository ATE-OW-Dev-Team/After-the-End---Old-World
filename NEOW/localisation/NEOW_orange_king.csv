orange_king_DESC;The Orange King faithful are a relatively small and militant sect of Thelema who pledge their undying loyalty to the King in Orange, and his chosen few who form the upper eschelons of the Orange Order. They believe that the Orange King, the consort of the Queen of the Heavens, rules the Earth while his beloved Queen rules the stars. His worshippers never forgot the near destruction of the faithful at the hands of the followers of the Arrogant Healer, ordered by their devil-pope, the highest servant of Choronzon, hellbent to destroy the free thinking and True Will of man.;;;;;;;;;x
