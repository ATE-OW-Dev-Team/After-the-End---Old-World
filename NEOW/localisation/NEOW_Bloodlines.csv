bloodlines6Title;The Ascension of Mann;;;;;;;;;x
bloodlines6Desc;Throughout much of its history, the Isle of Mann has seldom known true freedom. Its strategic location has long attracted the attention of numerous conquerors, each eager to claim the island for themselves. These invaders often intermingled with the locals, forging the resilient and proud people who now call the island home. Thanks to the efforts of [e_mann.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick], the [manx.GetName] people have risen to new heights, establishing an empire that might rival the glory of ancient Rome itself.;;;;;;;x

Though the union had long since dissolved, its legacy remained deeply rooted in the hearts of many people. However, centuries of disunity was reversed through the actions of [e_commonwealth.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick] who emulates their ancestral glory through the restoration of the Commonwealth. The people of Poland and Lithunia now rejoice, knowing the great union stands tall once more.

bloodlines8Title;A Light Shines Over Hindustan;;;;;;;;;x
bloodlines8Desc;Since long before the Event, legends have told of Hindustan, a powerful Muslim realm that dominated much of India, stretching from the Darab mountains all the way to the rich and fertile soil of Bengal. Though with time, it slowly declined due to instability and infighting before eventually collapsing to the army of the British Queen, plunging the land of the Hind to fall into darkness. Now, for the first time in centuries, under the leadership of [e_mughal.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick], the light of Islam shines brightly over India once more, and [e_mughal.Holder.GetSheHe] has been crowned [e_mughal.Holder.GetTitle], ushering a new era of prosperity for the region as a whole.

bloodlines9Desc;Since long before the Event, legends have told of time where all the people of India were united under the great banner of Bharat, a realm so vast that it encompasses the entire subcontinent. Many before us have claimed to rule these lands, from the Persian Mohammedans to the British Queen, but through all hardships our ancestors have preserved, working tirelessly to push out these invaders from our homeland, all led by the fabled Samrat Chakravartin. Though Bharat has long since fallen, its memory has been etched deep into the hearts of people for centuries. Now, through the great efforts of [e_india.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick], the lands of Bharat are united once more all under [e_india.Holder.GetHerHis] rule, acting as the divine aegis of India and protecting the realm once more from foreign dominance as the newly declared Samrat Chakravartin.
