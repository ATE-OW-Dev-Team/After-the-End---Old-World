BM_WESTERN_EUROPE_ERA;Cradle of Empires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WESTERN_EUROPE_ERA_INFO;The continent of Europe has been a hotbed of conflict, both religious and political, for millennia. While the shadow of Rome has significantly weakened, more empires have since risen and fallen. In the west, the recently shattered Novelist empire of Númenor has left a massive power vacuum, one partially filled by the esoteric British Empire, but more importantly beginning a new era of Christian aggression - the Crusades. In the east, the unstable Transnistrian Empire is giving Russian folk new hope that their motherland will again be the hegemon of all Europe, be it through conquest or human sacrifice. Lastly, in the south, the fledgling empire of Yugoslavia has come into conflict with both the Catholics of the West and the Orthodox of the East, seeking to unite the region under a shared, syncretic religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JKC_ERA;The Far East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JKC_INFO;To the east of the plains of the Urals and the Plateau of Tibet stand vast plains, powerful archipelagos and rich trading Empires. The shadow of Vladivostok looms over it all, the Grand City having established its power through War and Trade. But power is a fickle thing, and many nations grow in the shadow of the Grand City, seeking their spot in the Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_INDIA_ERA;The Lands of Dharma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_INDIA_ERA_INFO;The Empire of Siam was once the true hegemonic power in all of South-East Asia. However, a civil war and a broken throne have left the opening for a great opportunity. The Narasimha Confederacy once ruled the south of India and influenced the entire subcontinent, but now the Emperor is dead, and a child sits on the Throne. In the aftermath, the rich trade routes of Malacca and the uncountable resources of India stand free for the taking. And those are riches any ruler would die for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORTH_AFRICA_ERA;The Lands of Sand and Rivers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORTH_AFRICA_ERA_INFO;Africa is a varied land, even in the limited reaches of the Mediterranean and the northern Indian Ocean. In this land, the great Sahara Desert and the great River Nile are the core of life for most: one is a shield that divides the Mediterranean from the powers of the south, the other is a great boon to both agriculture and trade. And it is in the surrounding lands that domains great and small fight for supremacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MIDDLE_ASIA_ERA;Heartland of Faiths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MIDDLE_ASIA_ERA_INFO;The Middle East has been for millennia a land of religious birth and conflict: from here come the Abrahamic Faiths, and so it is unsurprising that even now all three fight for supremacy. However, that is not to say that new faiths can also come into place, rising from the time before the Event or from the ashes of dead cities. Who shall win, only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_29900000;To the North-West of the Empire of Nigeria and the Kingdoms of Liberia and Guinea stands the proud kingdom of two rivers. Ruling over the land between Senegal and Gambia, King Marcel-François of Senegal is a powerful ruler with close ties to the powerful Nigerian Emperors, even following their same faith. However, not all is good in the rivers kingdom. The Gambia still holds the faith of their ancestors, and the same do other petty lords. Will the choice to convert prove good for King Marcel-François, or will it doom his Kingdom to civil war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664192;The Nigerian Empire is the most powerful Empire of Africa, and perhaps of the entire world. However, while its rulers can claim power beyond any other, they also have to fear their enemies, be they vassals, invaders, or even their own family. It is thus not uncommon for Nigerian nobility to be exiled by the Emperors even out of simple suspicions. Such was the fate of Eze Obiajulu, a Nigerian Prince exiled for being a Scion of the old Imperial Family. However, where most others would simply travel to foreign courts, Eze Obiajulu carved his own domain in Africa. And now, his eyes set on the Eagle Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664251;The ancient Kingdom of Ethiopia lies broken and divided after the Event, with many Petty Kings scrambling over its bountiful lands, under the watchful but hardly active eye of the Coptic Popes of Aksum. Amongst them, up in the north, one of the most prominent of 2555 is Abai, ruler of Semien. Bordering many dangerous foes, King Abai has great goals, aiming to the throne of Ethiopia. But will he succeed, or will he just fall and disappear like others before him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664043;At the height of its power, Prussia extended through most of northern Germany. Yet, after the Battle of Danzig broke the power of the Prussianist heresy, Prussia was forced to give up much of its conquest and to turn to the original Lutheran church, their power has dwindled more and more, falling behind the young Bavaria or the powerful Svizzereich in the German lands. Willhelm Zollern, current King of Prussia, has the task of ensuring the success of a dwindling kingdom. Will the future of Prussia be saved, or will it continue in its downward spiral?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664161;The Calvinists gained control of Switzerland shortly after the Event, giving birth to a new Kingdom where Kings are elected based on their holiness, proving they are truly chosen to ascend to Heaven after death. In those centuries, the Swiss language has evolved fusing the various speeches of their land. Now, the King of the Svizzereich is Franz Klosters, a man many believe to be destined for Heaven. If he proves successful, he might prove all he is, but if he fails, the rule of House Klosters will likely be challenged soon... if the Svizzereich survives his mistakes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661219;The Deformed Erik Leroux rules over the greatest of the French Duchies, the Duchy of Grand Est. While not of an ancient Numenorean line like other rulers, behind the mask of a deformed, malnourished ghost is a man of great cunning, if not great military might. And with his eyes set on France, it might be only a matter of time before the Leroux line takes control of all of Numenor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661100;The history of Britain after the Event saw the followers of Thelema rise in power to form a great empire. The height of this empire was reached by none other than House Cyflymarhyan, the fourth and current imperial dynasty of Britain. Ruling an empire stretching from the Faroes to Thouars, the future seemed to shine on Lord Protector Frydyryk II, until the day Ireland took up arms in the name of Christendom. Now, the island is in open revolt against the Empire, and should the rebellion last too long, other factions might try to take control. Frydyryk can only win and ensure the future of Britain, or fail and risk dooming the rule of Britannia across the waves of the Atlantic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661202;Once a powerful empire stretching from the Benelux to the Pyrenees, Númenor has now fallen apart, broken into squabbling states. However, the blood of Isildur Bonaparte, the founder of Númenor, still survives in the north, in the veins of the Petty King of Picardy. As Britannia faces the first serious revolt in centuries, it might be time for the Bonapartes to retake what was once theirs. Will the King return to Gondor, or will the hope of the Novelists wither and die?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661300;Long ago, Benelux was the first Empire of Europe, ruled by the line of Belgium-Oranje-Nassau-Weilburg. This great dynasty did not disappear once the Empire was conquered by Numenor, and once the Novelist Empire fell Benelux resurfaced, as a new Novelist power. However, the last Emperor chose to break his domain in three parts, one Kingdom for each of his sons. And the oldest, Philippe of Luxembourg, is not pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26660515;At one point, Castille was close to restore ancient Spain, ruling over Galicia and the Asturias and all the land up to the rulers of the coast and Pyrenees. Then, under a tyrant king, it lost more and more land, ending with Galicia y Asturias and Extremadura seceding and much of their southern lands being taken by the Kings of Andalusia and Catalonia. Many of them have tried to take back their lost land, but none of them have been successful. King Alfonso Borbon is a long reigning man that failed like many of his predecessors, but he too aims to be the one that will see success;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664006;Formed only relatively recently and doomed to instability from its inception, Yugoslavia is an unlikely empire in a divided region. Believing religious differences to be the main source of divide, the previous Emperor founded Jugoslavism - a syncretic religion that fuses Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Sunni Islam into a single faith. However, most believe this religion to be a fraud, paying only lip service to the Emperor so as to not risk losing their head, while they practice their true beliefs in secret. Edmund Crnodjordjevic now sits on the throne, and has a difficult mission ahead to keep the Empire and his faith from falling apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664016;At the height of its power, Greece threatened the entire Balkan peninsula, with an army of thousands of Companions making the ground shake with their charges. However, their war against Yugoslavia ended this hegemony, with Greece losing land, its border regions independent, and turned into a tributary under the Emperor of the north. Greece has fallen low, and many fear forever. However, House Olympios still lives, under King Emerikos. Will he ensure Greece rises to dominance once more, or will he forever stay a tributary of the Yugoslavian Emperors?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26669125;Gennady Zyuganov is the most powerful Stalinist in all of Europe. This fringe faith believes Stalin is the only true Tsar of all Russia, known to them only as the Soyuz. This religion is far from stable and seems destined to obscurity, with its believers being driven more and more to the tribal outskirts of Russia by Tsarists. And yet, Comrade Gennady has managed to carve out a new realm around the legendary Stalingrad, and has proclaimed himself and his followers as the Defenders of the People. Will Stalinists survive and become the one true Tsarist sect, or are they truly destined to die off?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664146;Feodor Uspenskiy is one of the most powerful Folklorists. Those people that live deep in the north of Russia follow a great number of regional believes, tied together by few common elements. This pagan faith is a dangerous force to face, even in its divided state. In ancient times, the mysterious Vedmak-Korol spread it far and wide, and now, it is people like Alexei that are tasked with keeping the terror of the nights at bay. But whether they can do that or not, is up solely to their ability as rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664081;Once, as the Novelist Empire threatened the west, in the east Catholicism was facing the danger of the faith of Romuva. After the fall of Benelux, the Popes organized a great Holy League, and the kingdom of the Romuva, Lithuania, was destroyed, its population forced into conversion or executed. Then, the Catholic Grand Duchy of Lithuania was formed, and over the century, it grew to become the greatest Catholic state of Europe. Its current King is close to declare himself Emperor of the Commonwealth, but will he succeed despite the wavering loyalty of his Belarusian vassals? And has Romuva truly been destroyed forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26669000;After the Event, Transnistria rose to take control of the divided lands of Eastern Europe. Following Orthodox teachings and hosting the head of the faith, Transnistria at its height ruled everything between Romania and the Donkuban, its armies made of the cossacks' finest horses and of the fiercest warriors of Ukraine and Romania. Over the last century, however, Transnistria has weakened. Today, only Moldova and parts of Ukraine are ruled by the rump empire, and the King of Ukraine is powerful enough to question the authority of the Emperor. Is Transnistria to stabilise and return to power, or is it destined to disappear into the history books?;;;;;;;;;;;;;xv

ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672219;In the not-so-distant past, large swathes of western India was under the dominion of Sikandar. Over the course of his rule, most of his empire, with the exception of Rajasthan, broke away, and it too was gone when he died. Can his son and heir restore his empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_4000000;When the Event hit, no place on Earth of was left undamaged. However, the Thunder Dragon Empire proved to be, if not an exception, very close to one. The Empire of the Thunder Dragon maintained many forms of craft lost to the rest of the world, and is an island of light in this dark age. However, their isolation has made them slow to adapt: over time, they have grown far too accustomed to this state, and today it is hard to imagine that the Dragon might wake. But if it was to do so, the entirety of Asia might be destined to tremble under the rule of the Dragon Emperors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672014;The kingdom of Lanka has seen better days. Currently embroiled in civil war, King Kavishan must struggle to keep his throne from his upstart son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672031;The vast empire established by the Narasimha dynasty is in truth a confederation of loosely united rulers. The Emperors rule over much of the Deccan Plateu, and are powerful enough to aim for the unification of southern India, and maybe even beyond. However, recently the Emperor has died, substituted by his son, a mere child and the last of his line. With many of his vassals looking at the throne with greed in their eyes, will Jayaraj Narasimha and his Empire survive this struggle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_266611108;A few years ago, a party of foreign ships appeared on the cost of India. Battered and weakened, they sailed around the coast, looking for a safe dock. Once they finally reached the weakened city of Kalikut, their leader James Crowhill ordered an assault and took the city, forcing its ruler to relinquish all his titles to him. Thus house Crowhill, the mysterious adventurers from the far island of Britain, came to rule over this small piece of Indian land. Followed by many Thelema warriors, this man claims that India was once the Jewel of the Crown of the Queen. And he is here to return it to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672051;Karchen Nyigon is the King of Guge. The most powerful of the Tibetan Kingdoms, this great domain is the core of the Gelugpa faith, the Buddhist branch that follows the Dalai Lama chosen by his peers. This, of course, brings him at odds with the Karmapa Buddhists, who believe the Penchen Lama to be the only one that can name a Dalai Lama. Seeing each other as heretic, the Gelugpa and the Karmapa have been at each other's throat for centuries. But many claim the two Kings of the faith might be ready to soon settle this vicious debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664259;The Kingdom of Sudan stands as a pillar of faith for all Sunni, one of the Great Kingdoms of Africa and the only one that still follows the oldest of all Muslim sects. John Dawoud is a wise ruler, and many believe his reign is meant to last. However, as new branches of Islam grow in power all around Africa, this wise king might have to soon pick up the sword to defend his believes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664192;The mighty Kingdom of Chad is one of located in an harsh land, south of the great Sahara desert and just east of the Nigerian Governatorate. However, the beautiful and strong King Adergazuz Dabadi, follower of the faith of Sufism, a post-Event branch of Islam derived from the ancient Sufi schools, seems to be blessed as a great man. Perhaps, he is the right man to unite Africa and fend off the Nigerians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664220;Maghreb, the Empire of the Atlas, was established once more after the Event first crushed it so long ago. Ruled by the Alouite dynasty and followers of a peculiar faith that claims only them have the right to be Caliphs, the Alouite have greatly expended, from the edges of the Sahara to the coast of old Algeria, absorbing in their conquest the Israeli colonies and the Sunni Algerians. Now, Hassan Alouite is set on claiming all the Maghreb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664193;The Sahara Desert is a harsh wasteland where no great kingdom can sprout. Instead, various tribes of nomadic people fight for control on the region and of the trade from the southern kingdoms to the northern ones. From Bir um Grein to Mokhtar, Tuareg, Barbariyya and Toubu clans fight for control of the desert roads. Those nomadic clans tend to disappear and get overturned by their internal feuds, only to follow a new leader in raids both to other clans and outside of the desert, where they are equally respected and feared. Pascal Djaribe is one of those men, a feared warlord of the rocks and sands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664228;The Occitan adventurer Pierre Gericault fled the growing power of Edmond Dantés, and with his few retainers fled to Algeria, where legends tell of a long gone Kingdom once ruled by the French. Here, he has conquered a vast swath of land, extending over much of lost Algeria. But still, he borders many dangerous enemies that find him and his faith unpleasing. Only time will tell if this young domain will survive or wither and die, if the light of Eru will bring strength to this land or if it will just fade and disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664258;In the lands of the old eastern kingdoms of Africa today stand a squabbling mess of various warrior states, fighting over control of the region that once formed fabled lands like Ethiopia, Erithrea or Somalia. It's the great fighting ground of the cross and moon, a land of constant warfare... Except for the stable Republic of Djibouti. Controlling the access to the Red Sea, this famed country is seen as a light of hope in the warthorn country said. Under the rule of Abimelech Lanfadera, the Merchants of Djibouti trade both north and east, gaining much from their control over the crucial route.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26662801;Israel, the homeland of Judaism, has managed to survive post Event thanks to two advantage: the control of the ports of the Mediterranean, which gave it great richness, and the rule over the great fortresses of Acre and Jerusalem. Those forts managed to defend the borders of the Kingdom through the hardest post-event wars, holding their most important Holy Sites. However, this changed. The fall of Acre caused great concern in the kingdom, with many fearing a third diaspora may soon fall on them. David ben David, current King of Israel, has proved to be a great military ruler, as his victory against the Sauds shows, and has many sons to ensure the survival of his dynasty, but it may not be enough to ensure the survival of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26670006;The lands of Mesopotamia where once the cradle of civilization, the heart of Empires and nations unlike any on Earth. And before the Event, many had tried to claim back that legacy, the heritage of Babylon, the Assyrian Empire and great Ur. It took the Event to see one of those attempts give fruit. A warlord named Mubarak, a fool to many, a weird man to most, one day in his youth stumbled in what he simply described as “great ruins containing books unlike any I have ever read”. It was a collection of legends and histories on the ancient world, and on the rule of kings like Gilgamesh or Nabuchadnezzar. With those revelations, he begun to craft the new faith. Mesopotamianism follows the teachings of those great Kings, integrated into Islam. And in the following decades, Dayanu Mubarak al-Mubarak has expanded his influence, founding the al-Mubarak Emirate that controls much of the land core of his faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26670003;The Sauds ruled Arabia before the event, and after a brief age of chaos they reclaimed their throne. Ruling from the Persian Gulf, they rebuilt their country, conquering the Nefoud, Mecca and Medina. However, even if they could unify their old country, they were unable to claim absolute authority over the faith. Salafism remained the dominating faith of the family and their lands, and the Nefoud tribes accepted it, but the western coast remained strongly Sunni. In recent years, the situation has changed dramatically. With the fall of the Sultan in his battle against Israel, the throne passed to his first son, Muhammad. However, Muhammad's relatives seek to expand their influence, his brothers now both claim the throne. A civil war is soon to hit Arabia, and bordering powers watch with great interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26641001;The Kingdom of Georgia has managed to solidify a long time ago, fighting off the new faiths to protect the belief in the Orthodox church. This age of warfare has made the veneration of the great Saint George a great national pride, with many claiming the Reconquest of all of Anatolia is part of the destiny of this great kingdom. It is up to King Nika Bagrationi to deliver on such destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26671005;The power of the Shiite faith has shrinked much since the Event, divided in minor domains and enraged by both new faiths like Mesopotamianism and older rivalries with Sunni and Baha'i. However, the Khorasani rulers have proven a powerful exception. Their rule over the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and have grown to control much of northern Iran. Now, they have the opportunity to march south and attempt to destroy both new and old rivals once and for all. However, they must be careful, for their proximity to the steppe, has allowed them to hear whisphers of a great migration south from Siberia which could threaten their power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26671007;The Baha'i faith is a faith that dates back to before the Event. Never as powerful as others, it still survived the Event in Iran, though divided, a minority in such lands. However, recently a revolt led by the great Vaharam Effendi was successful in taking a coastal region and forming the first Baha'i state worth of notice since the disaster that struck humanity. Vaharam's position is far from secure, but he knows the future of Baha'i rests on his shoulders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
