###ASCENDED MASTERS###
EVTITLE_ascension_pathstart;Start the Path to Spiritual Enlightenment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathstart;It is believed that Ascended Masters are individuals who were formerly embodied on the Earth and learned the lessons of life during their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the matter planes. Ascended Masters serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of spirit, and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. It might be possible to gain such ascension with sufficient spiritual enlightenment, through meditation and study...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOTPA_ascendedmaster_pathstart;All Life is One.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOTPB_ascendedmaster_pathstart;I am ignorant, I am not ready for Enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_ascension_pathstart1;Returning Incarnation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle1;Although you've taken the first step to Spiritual Enlightenment, there is still a long way to go on the path to becoming an Ascended Master. The next step on the path to becoming an Ascended Master is exploring the doctrine of returning once or partial enlightenment through trials of body and mind. Hopefully, you will best these trials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTA_ascendedmaster_2;Enlightenment is a long path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle2;As your meditation continues, you find yourself hardly able to move or think. Your teachers told you that fasting was merely optional, but you get the feeling that ending your meditation early will reduce your chances of achieving Enlightenment. On the other hand, there are more trials ahead, and you may not be able to pass them in this state...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTA_ascendedmaster_3;I will overcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTB_ascendedmaster_52;I can't take it anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTC_ascendedmaster_3;Perhaps nobody will notice if I sneak some food...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle3;The next test presented to you is a trial by combat. The teachers claim that this is needed to test not only your physical fitness, but your ability to think on your feet. Your opponent unsheathes his sword...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTA_ascendedmaster_4;En garde!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle4;After a long and exhausting fight, you finally emerge victorious. As you collapse onto the floor yourself, you hear one of the teachers speak. "Well done. We will give you a few days to recover before presenting you with the next test.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTA_ascendedmaster_5;Not only wisdom...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle5;After a long an exhausting fight, you collapse onto the floor in defeat. As your opponent leaves the field, you hear one of the professors speak. "Unfortunate. We will give you a few days to recover before presenting you with the next test.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVOPTA_ascendedmaster_6;I need rest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle6;Your professors have called you to a small chamber in a local temple for your final test. You see a single teacher writing something on the wall in front of you. "For your final test, you must uncover the meaning of the riddle written on this wall. You have two hours." The teacher leaves the room, leaving you alone with the riddle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_7;Hmmm... Of course! The answer is Atlantis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_7;A drowned city? What could it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_ascension_pathmiddle7;Enlightened Once Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle7;You have completed all of your trials, and have gathered the teachers before you in your court to hear the results of your trial. "You have not only passed all of the tests, but exceeded our expectations every time. You have proven yourself beyond worthy, and you have proven your status as Once Returned. May your great wisdom and strength carry you to greater Spiritual Enlightenment.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_9;I am honored, teachers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_ascension_pathmiddle8;Once-Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle8;You have completed all of your trials, and have gathered the teachers before you in your court to hear the results of your trial. ""After much consideration, we have decided to confer upon you the status of Once Returned. May your further travels carry you to greater Spiritual Enlightenment.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_10;I am honored, teachers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_ascension_pathmiddle9;Exiting the Stream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathmiddle9;You have completed all of your trials, and have gathered the teachers before you in your court to hear the results of your trial. "After much consideration, we have decided that you are unworthy of being Once Returned.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_11;Maybe next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_ascension_pathend1;Become an Ascended Master;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend1;You have advanced far along the path of Spiritual Enlightenment, but your final and most difficult challenge lays ahead of you. For the next month, you will be sequestered in a cave, without food, water, or even clothing. It is said that, through deep contemplation, you may not only survive this experience, but emerge with a new understanding of Truth and the universe. Before setting out, however, you must prepare...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_13;I will exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_13;I will study esoteric lore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_13;I will drink and be merry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend2;You arrive at the cave, and the entrance is sealed behind you. As you sit inside the cave, you begin to think about what to do in order to achieve success. You should probably medidate on Truth — that is the point, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_14;I will try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_14;I am already halfway there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_14;Truth is a ponderous thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend3;After a week spent alone, the effects of having no clothing become apparent. The nights are bitterly cold, and it is taking a toll on your health. You can barely focus...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_15;I wish I could bundle up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_15;The thing is immemorial and universal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend65;After another week in the cave, the lack of proper food and water begins to take its toll. You can scarely think of anything besides food and water. Your arms are growing weak, and your stomach is in pain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_16;I am going to die here, aren't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_16;I AM, self-actualizing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend4;After three weeks spent in isolation, braving illness and hunger, you have achieved... nothing. You feel no closer to Truth now then you did when you entered this accursed stone prison. What was the point of this?!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_17;This is hopeless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_17;I won't achieve anything by despairing now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_17;This is intolerable! Damn the Truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ascension_pathend5;Ascension;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend5;During the final days of your meditation, you suddenly have a vision. A vision of a tree made of light, running from the Earth to the stars, and you lifted into the air, soaring around the tree. You see men and women of all races, cultures, and religion. Then it comes to you: a single, metaphysical truth that encompasses all knowledge, exoteric and esoteric. Truth is not merely found in our religion — truth is perennial. Religions are branches from a common trunk - Divine Wisdom. Truth is all around us, and we are Truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_19;One Principle Governing Form throughout Infinity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ascension_pathend6;Ascension Denied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ascension_pathend6;Your time in the cave has ended. You felt as if you were on the verge of death for much of that time. Some refer to death as your soul becoming one with Truth but somehow, you don't think that your experience allowed you to understand anything about the world that you did not already know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_20;I have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_ascended_path_1;The way is long and treacherous, but wisdom is priceless.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_ascended_path_2;Through trials and meditation, you reach closer to truth.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_ascended_path_3;The ultimate revelation is right there, just beyond reach.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_thestartofascension;But what does that really mean?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_notinterestedinascendedmaster;Many are called, but few are chosen.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_2;And the first step is to empty oneself.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascended_master_3;An empty belly means a soul ready to be filled.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascended_master_3;Illumination is hard enough without a growling stomach.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_3;Sometimes we must create our own hidden truth.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_53;But the greatest conflict is with the false self.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_7;Knowledge is not the sum of wisdom, but it doesn't hurt.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_7;Knowledge is not the sum of wisdom, but it wouldn't hurt.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_9;But who is worthy but they who know they are not worthy?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_11;Even the Buddha had to wander before he found his way.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_13;The body is the carriage of the soul, cradle and throne.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_13;Secrets are not the Truth, but they whisper her name.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_13;Wisdom is awareness paired with action, even before doom.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_14;But what is trying when there is only do and do-not?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_14;What truth can hide from one who knows everything?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_14;What is Truth? Where is Truth? Who is Truth? Why is Truth?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_15;Naked before the cold, naked before harsh realities...;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_15;Perseverance is half the battle, giving time to grasp the other.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_16;Will your next life get closer, or was this all folly?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_16;Something beckons. It may be all inside your head, but what isn't?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_17;Your soul reaches. Grasps. Pleads. Nothing yet, nothing yet...;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTB_ascendedmaster_17;Night is darkest just before dawn, but where's your sun?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTC_ascendedmaster_17;If Truth conquers all, why does the coward hide from you?;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_19;There is no religion higher than Truth because Truth stands forever.;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_EVTOPTA_ascendedmaster_20;If no religion is higher than truth, how can you ever reach high enough?;;;;;;;;;x
