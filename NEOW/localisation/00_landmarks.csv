landmark_atomium;§YAtomium§!\nThe original Atomium, a great building fruit of pre-Event engineers with long lost knowledge, has been lost forever, its metal melted, rusted or lost. The building was remembered by all inhabitants of Brussel, who asked often for something to be done about the loss of such creation. Therefore, the Emperors of Benelux had a statue built. Made of stone rather than metal, and only two meters tall, the statue is nonetheless a beloved landmark of Brabant and Belgium, although many wonder whether the shape is correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_arrows_field;§YArrows' Field§!\nThe location where the Battle of the Arrows, the bloodiest battle of the Turbulent Years, took place. The armies of Winnifred Strongboar and Fragran Knights, both trying to seize the throne of Britannia, faced each other for five days, leaving thousands of dead on the field. The Battle was won by a decisive attack from the archers of the future Empress, and while it was not the last time the two clashed, it brought a decisive advantage to he side. To this day, Arrows' Field is avoided by travelers, as many claim the spirits of the dead haunt the place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_basilica_of_propiciator;§YBasilica of the Propiciator§!\nThis newly built Basilica was erected by the Emperor of Yugoslavia to be the seat of the Propiciator of the Yugoslavist faith. The land around it, sparsely populated and located near the borders of mostly Sunni Bosnia Herzegovina, mostly Catholic Croatia and mostly Orthodox Serbia, was seen as perfect to show unity of the three faith, and was granted directly to the church to rule. However, the area has not improved much since, with the Propiciator merely organizing the expansion of the surrounding city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_base_of_the_tour_eiffel;§YBase of the Tour Eiffel§!\nFor a long time the Tour Eiffel was a symbol of Paris. After the Event, however, the great iron tower steadily deteriorated, until one of the rulers of Paris was forced to have it torn down to both scavenge the surviving material and make sure it wouldn't fall on the surrounding buildings. The base was however left, along with the four legs under request of most of the population. Since then, great effort has been put into preserving at least these last parts of the Tower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_big_ben;§YBig Ben§!\nThis great tower stands above the city of London since long before the Event, never falling in the face of time and weather. While the clock has long stopped moving, the building has been turned into a great watchtower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_black_gate;§YBlack Gate§!\nThe Black Gate is believed by the inhabitants of Trier to be the oldest building in all of Germany. It was of little fame outside of the region until the Battle of the Black Gate in 2530, when Trier managed to defeat against a Novelist host despite being pushed to the gate by the attack, marking a great victory for Christianity. The Novelists, on the other hand, claim the Black Gate is a dark symbol of one of their evil gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_brandeburg_gate;§YBrandeburg Gate§!\nThe Brandeburg Gate is a symbol of Germany since before the Event. While the Prussians claim it was built by ancient Prussian Kings, other claim it was erected by a German King or Emperor. Whatever the truth, the Brandeburg Gate stands in the center of Berlin, a symbol of the glory of the ancient Kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_castel_del_monte;§YCastel del Monte§!\nThe octagonal plant of this remarkable piece of Pre-Event engineering has puzzled men for centuries. Who built it, and why?

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_iss_crashsite;§YAncient Sky Vessal Crashsite§!\nScattered and buried in several ancient craters in this region there exists the remains of what is believed to have been a Sky Ship that once Soared above the visible sky. The wreckage has mostly been left to turn white and red over the centuries as Ironists view the site as holy, an exception was made for two swords made using pieces of the "Sky Silver" or "Aspan Kümisi" metal that the ship was constructed using.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_castle_dracula;§YCastle Dracula§!\nThis old castle is believed by Novelists to have been the seat of one of the Lieutenant of Morgoth, the King of Bats, Count Dracula. Ancient tails tell of how the legendary hero Aragorn and his companions fought him. As his companions died or had to stay behind, Aragorn fought Dracula. He was on the verge of death, but the sun of dawn shone at the last second on his sword, a gift he had received by Aslan the Lion, blinding Dracula long enough for him to behead him. Since then, Castle Dracula has fallen more and more into disrepair, and the Novelists stay far away from it, cause it is said that bats and wolves still haunt its halls waiting for the return of their dark master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_chernobyl_forest;"§YChernobyl Forest§!\nThis patch of land, known as Pripyat Forest, is said to have once contained the marvelous city of Chernobyl, where sophisticated Priests of the Old Soyuz tried to attain power of a great but obscure entity known as ""Atom"", but ultimately failed, bringing Atom's curse upon Europe. Though Great Rulers of the Soyuz and Old Ukraine contained the curse by building an enormous arch-like Sarcophagus made of steel around the city, locals still fear the curse and are maintaining the Sarcophagus to not let it out.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_colosseum;§YColosseum§!\nThe ancient Colosseum is a remnant of ages long past. A great arena similar to other found throughout Europe, the Colosseum is however said to have been where the greatest warriors would fight for the glory and honor of the Emperor.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_don_herd;§YDon's Herds§!\nThese plains are known for the impressive amount of wild horses of the Don Budyonny stock. The Cossacks catch wild horses as their steeds, but the number of those majestic stallions never seems to grow lower.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_gran_catedral_de_la_iglesia_sevilliana;§YGran Catedral de la Iglesia Sevilliana (Great Cathedral of the Sevillian Church)§!\nThe first Cathedral of the Sevillian Church and the seat of the Sevillian Pope stands in the center of the great city of Seville.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_gran_plaza_de_toros;§YGran Plaza de Toros (Great Bullring)§!\nThe Gran Plaza de Toros of Pamplona is the most famous bullring in all of Iberia. The Basque Kings themselves visit yearly the city during the famous Encierro, the bull run where hundreds of people run from the best bulls in the country until reaching the great arena. While it is unclear how the sport started, many kings and nobles have run along with peasants, not without some tragedy over the centuries. Other parts of Spain see the sport as barbaric compared to the Corrida, but the people of Pamplona defend it as a great proof of bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_hermannsdenkmal;§YHermannsdenkmal (Hermann's Monument)§!\nThis great monument is seen by many Germans as a symbol of victory over invaders.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_house_nation;§YHouse of the Nation§!\nIt is said that once this great building was were the nobles of the realm would meet to discuss the future of Hungary. After the Event, it became the royal palace, where the rulers of Budapest or the Kings of Hungary would reside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_kalemegdan;§YKalemegdan§!\nThis ancient park around the Fortress of Belgrade is filled with statues and buildings from the ancient and new world. Amongst those the most heavily respected by the people of Belgrade are the statue of the Victor, that celebrates the defeat of a great empire to the north, and the Broken Crown of Greece, a statue built to remember the defeat of the Hellenists by the first Emperor of Yugoslavia. Since the Fortress is only used as a place to store food in case of war, with newer building being used as residence for the Emperor or his main forces, access to the park is not restricted, and is one of the few places in Yugoslavia where nobles and commoners can come into regular contact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_kremlin;§YKremlin§!\nThis great fortress in the middle of Moskau held strong against many disasters, both before and after the Event. While some towers have been torn down and some have been built since the Event, the overall shape has remained the same throughout history. The Zarists believe it to have been the seat of the Tsars, though the Stalinist instead believe it to be the great seat of Stalin. Many wonders are kept inside it, including the Tsar Bell. It also used to host the Tsar Cannon, a legendary weapon it is said the mightiest Tsar could wield with a single hand, but the object is lost, possibly hidden in some room, possibly destroyed for the iron it is said it was made of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_last_cross;§YLast Cross of Benelux§!\nThe Last Cross of Benelux is found in the location of the last battle between the Numenorean Army and the Catholic Beneluxian Army. The bloodiest battle of the invasion, to embolden his troops the Emperor of Benelux brought on the field a great stone cross, declaring that Benelux would either win or die by it. And die they did, with the final resistance ending with over three hundred of the finest Beneluxian warriors died around the cross rather than surrendering. However, the sight of the cross covered in blood and surrounded by the bodies of those honorable heroes was so magnificent and terrifying the Emperor of Numenor himself declared the Last Cross was to be left there, 2317 engraved on it to remember the year. It stands to this day, the only surviving cross in all of Benelux.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_loch_ness;§YLoch Ness§!\nA famous loch in the Scottish Highlands. It is said a vicious monster inhabits its waters since before the Event.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_lost_arnor;§YThe Lost King of Arnor§!\nThe Novelist Empire of Numenor at its apex extended from Benelux to Spain, but its core was always in the great Kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor, in the territories other remember as France and Aquitaine. Arnor was the first to fall apart in the fall of Numenor, and to this day the Novelists dream of restoring the lost Kingdom. In the Center of Marseille stands the great statue of Isildur Bonaparte, founder of the Empire, in eternal memory of the Kingdom. The Population fiercely opposes any attempt at its removal, some say in fear of what would happen were the King to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_minsk_library;§YThe Great Library§!\nWhile most of the great library of Europe have been lost in the Event or in the following wars, the Great Library of Minsk was seen by the inhabitants of the city as a great treasure, and thus was kept protected. This unnaturally shaped building has many legends, from claims of forbidden knowledge hidden in its halls to tales of spirits haunting it at night to protect the great books. Librarians from all over Numenor used to visit here at the Empire's height, despite the danger of the journey seeking to recover more of the Novel's knowledge, and the Romuva overlord of the time would allow that. The Christian rulers of Belarus and Lithuania have since burned many of the most accursed books, but do not dare to burn more than the strictly necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_mont_blanc;§YMont Blanc/Monte Bianco (White Mountain)§!\nThis peak located in the western Alps is often called the highest peak in all of Europe. This knowledge seems to come from pre-Event memories, but some claim one of the Fourteen Paladins, Jean the Brave, rests at the mountain peak on his throne of ice and stone, waiting for when Europe will be in need of him and his companions. He will awake them from their tombs throughout Europe and summon them to battle once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_mount_athos;§YSt. Mount Athos§!\nThe seat of a great Orthodox monastery since long before the Event, the loss of Mount Athos to the Hellenists was a great blow to the pride of the Orthodox faith. However, the decision to rise a location to Sainthood taken by the Orthodox Patriarch of the time was heavily disputed, with many claiming it was unheard of and against scriptures to do so. Since then, many Patriarchs have tried to undo the saintification, only for others to restore it, claiming the state of Mount Athos as a Saint might spur the rightful Orthodox church into action to recover its lost land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_mount_tavor;§YMount Tavor§!\nRising prominently over the plains of the Galilee, Mount Tavor is one of the most distinct sights in the area. A site of religious significance for Christianity as it was the site of the transfiguration of Jesus and Judaism as it was prophesied that Tavor will be one of the sites where the Third Temple will be build, alongside Mounts Carmel and Jerusalem. Because of that, the Meshichist Jews of Israel have erected a large synagogue near the mount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_mount_meron;§YMount Meron§!\nSituated near the city of Safed in the Upper Galilee, Mount Meron is a site of religious significance for Judaism. It is the site of the tomb of the ancient Jewish sage Shimon bar Yochai and thus is a pilgrimage site for pious Jews across Israel who celebrate the anniversary of his death on the 33rd day of the Omer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_jerusalem;§YHoly City of Jerusalem§!\nAn ancient city of untold significance for Judaism, Christianity and Islam, for reasons too numerous to list. Jerusalem has been thrown into chaos in the aftermath of the event as religious strife flared up within its walls. Since then the situation has been stabilized by the clever politicking of the first 'restored' Kings of Israel. Temple Mount is left as neutral ground as the proclaimed Third Temple was decided to be built on Mount Scopus. This inconsistency with Jewish prophecies and the conflict arising from within the Jewish religious sphere is one of the progenitors of the Mikraist movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_neuschwanstein;§YNeuschwanstein§!\nThe Great Castle of Neuschwanstein is the summer house of the rulers of the region, first Dukes and now Kings.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_san_marino;§YSan Marino§!\nThe ancient settlement of San Marino is believed by its inhabitants to be the oldest surviving country in the world.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_santiago_de_compostela;§YSantiago de Compostela§!\nThe legendary Tomb of Saint James has been for time immemorial the preferred pilgrimage site of Catholics from Europe and beyond.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_statue_of_king_niall;§YStatue of King Niall Dev§!\nA statue built in memory of King Niall Dev, third King of Ireland after the Event and first to rule from Dublin.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_the_sacred_mosque;§Yal-Masjid al-Haram (The Sacred Mosque)§!\nAs it has done for millennia, the Sacred Mosque stands. Here still runs the water of the Well of Zamzam, here every man of the faith comes to complete the Hajj, and here is located the Kaaba, the holiest place in all of Islam.

And today, like every other day past and future, the prayers and steps do not cease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_tomb_of_thez;§YTomb of Thez the Mighty§!\nA great Mausoleum stands in this province, surrounded by the statues of thirteen knights in armor. A fourteenth one lays on the inside, atop a great sarcophagus. This is the tomb of Thez the Mighty, founder and leader of the legendary Fourteen Paladins of Fame and Fortune, heroes that during the Event fought bravely to defend the people of France, Spain and Portugal. The statue shows a man almost two meters tall, with a metal arm and a missing eye, along with a weapon too big to be called a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_valle_de_los_caidos;§YValle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen)§!\nThis monumental complex was built before the event by the Spanish rulers. It guards the corpses of the fallen in an ancient conflict lost in history, though many great generals and kings have been honored with being laid to rest here since the Kingdom of Castille was established.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_fortress_monestaries;§YThe Fortress Monasteries of Andorra§!\nThe fortress monasteries of Andorra have stood as a bastion of the Catholic faith for centuries yet as the Sevillians grow stronger, how long will the King-Bishop last?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_wiener_staatsoper;§YWiener Staatsoper (Vienna State Opera)§!\nWhile many things have been lost since the Event, the people of Vienna still talk of when their city was called the City of Music and Dreams. Because of this it is unsurprising that the great opera house of Vienna stands to this day. The theater is the set of yearly celebrations where the best poets are invited to participate, singing to all that may want to listen. For the rest of the year, only nobles are allowed in the opera house, to observe the exhibitions of court poets from all of Germany, unless the rulers of Austria decide to open it to the people of Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_winter_palace;§YThe Winter Palace§!\nThis great palace in the great city of Pietropolis is an holy building for all Zarists, who claim this was the seat of great Tsars from Peter the Great to Nicholas the Passion-Bearer. The Stalinists, on the other hand, also claim it as an holy site, believing it to be where the Red Army, the ancient force directly under their god Stalin, captured the last of the false Tsars, ensuring Stalin his rightful place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_aswan_dam;§YThe Great Wall of Aswan§!\nThe great wall of Aswan has for centuries helped to tame the Nile and prevent both flooding and droughts to upper Egypt. Lake Nasser behind the great wall also acts as a major source of water and fishing for the local population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_the_deadlands;§YThe Deadlands§!\nThe land near to this province is dead, the soil is toxic, the water is poisonous, flora planted will die and what plants that do grow kill the animals that ingest them. Worse still, the land itself is hostile and often those foolish enough to enter do not return. The last signal of their lives being a thunderous crack as they cease to exist or a strange colored air being released which strangles all those it comes in contact with, both animal and man. These Lands are cursed. Yet there is one flower which has flourished in these places, the humble poppy fills many of the fields between the hardy trees. It is a local tradition to not disturb these poppies as they represent hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_the_oresund_sandbank;§YThe Øresund Sandbank§!\nBetween the ancient Dejure lands of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Denmark there lies a great sandbank blocking a large portion of the passage from the Baltic. This is no ordinary sandbank, instead it has formed upon the mighty skeleton of a pre-event bridge. This bridge was built in the antediluvian times when the ancient kings of Sweden and Denmark sought to bring their nations closer together. Even now in its ruined state it continues this as the sandbank and the adjoining antediluvian tunnel make travel between Sweden and Copenhagen by foot incredibly easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
landmark_moscow_metro;§YMoscow Metro§!\nBeneath this county lies a crisscrossing interconnected system of tunnels and while a good number of these tunnels are flooded due to the Moskva river enough of these tunnels are open to be useful during sieges.
