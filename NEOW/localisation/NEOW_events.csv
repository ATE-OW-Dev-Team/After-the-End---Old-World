Sometimes, they talk to you about religion, and you have to face the tough question of why the Sevillian Church even exists at all. Were the visions of one seer really sufficient grounds to split with Rome? And besides that, some of the people here have left everything behind, or at least lost vast sums of money, purely for the privilege of taking part in the Holy War. Certainly you rarely saw this kind of ardor in Spain. Could it be that the Roman Church truly is the real Catholic Church after all?;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEINVADERS1;Wars and Rumours of Wars;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCINVADERS1;Troubling rumours have been coming west in recent years, speaking of two great empires in the far east which are finally gearing up to settle their centuries-long grievance with each other. The rumours speak of these two realms as 'China' and 'Sibera', and claim that the two have been constantly feuding for hundreds of years. Whatever the result of this war, it will likely result in complete destruction for the loser.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_INVADERS1;No concern of ours.;;;;;;;;;x

,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEINVADERS2;The Cold Wind of the East;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCINVADERS2;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Chinese stand victorious. The Siberian Empire has been utterly crushed. Even now Chinese Governors establish military outposts in the snowy lands of Siberia, and tribute caravans laden with ivory and rare woods make their way to the Imperial City. While many Siberians remain in their homeland and acclimatise to foreign rule, a large group of the Siberian nobility, army, and peasants have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the wrath of China. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbours.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCINVADERS5;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Siberians stand victorious. The Great Empire of China has been shattered, and now a Siberian sits upon the Dragon Throne, having declared himself the founder of a new Dynasty and possessor of the Mandate of Heaven. As he prepares his armies for the decades-long task of pacifying the countryside and consolidating his rule, large sections of the defeated Chinese army, nobility and peasantry have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the chaos that is sure to result. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families.

parabrahmanist1Desc;Though there have always been warriors dedicated to fighting for the Smartist faith, so far they have been isolated and scattered, unable to coordinate their efforts beyond their local areas. Now, a group of powerful rulers have come together to provide extensive financial support for an order of holy warriors dedicated to defending the Smartist faith from all its enemies. These warriors have called themselves the Shiv Sena, and have sworn not to fight fellow followers of the religion of Bharat.;;;;;;;;;x

parabrahmanist2Desc;The Smartist religion has always been combatative, dedicated to expelling heathens and adharma from the holy land of India. However, they have recently suffered many defeats and setbacks, which has greatly worried many of the faithful. [From.GetTitledName] has heard these worries, and has decreed the formation of a new order for the defense of India. This new holy order, the Shiv Sena, is to be a band of warriors devoted to the defense of the Smartist religion, and is not to fight coreligionists under any circumstances. The Shiv Sena will surely be a prominent force in the religious wars of India from now on.;;;;;;;;;x

Now, the great Empire of Bharat is unified once again, and the holy land of India is safe from foreign invaders.;;;;;;;;;x
,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist4Title;The Dharmayudda;;;;;;;;;x
parabrahmanist4Desc;Though the Smartist religion has always advocated for holy struggle to liberate India from foreign religion and wickedness, their efforts have hardly ever been united, and they have spent nearly as much time fighting each other as fighting heathens. The Shankaracharya has declared that this has gone on too long. In a fiery speech given before a crowd of thousands, he has declared that all faithful Hindus should unite against the infidels, and strive together to reclaim the sacred land. This marks the beginning of a new era of Hindu holy wars - the Dharmayuddas.;;;;;;;;;x

But of all the lands of the Crown that were lost, the fabled America has always been foremost in the minds of the British.

With Imperial power waxing once more, the lords of Britannia have decided to prove themselves by doing what even their antediluvian ancestors could not - return to the land of America and conquer it.

the_minor_deities_desc;This character is emulating the various minor gods of Ylijumala's realm. Many of these hail from the ancient Finnish pantheon and the reasons for their ascensions have long been forgotten, but as time has proven they are nonetheless worthy of veneration.;;;;;;;;;x
the_luther;The Luther;;;;;;;;;x
the_luther_desc;This character is emulating Martin Luther, who Sisuists consider to be the father of their religion. He ascended to to divinity by fighting against tyranny, and his followers attempt to live lives of humility and charity to avoid bad sisu.;;;;;;;;;x
the_marshal;The Marshal;;;;;;;;;x
the_marshal_desc;This character is emulating Marshal Mannerheim, who Sisuists consider to be the defender of their homes from Stalin the Devourer. Mannerheim proved that unyielding courage and a desire to protect can boost a man to divinity, and so his followers act as vigilantes and militiamen where needed.;;;;;;;;;x
the_founder;The Founder;;;;;;;;;x
the_founder_desc;This character is emulating Kekkonen, who Sisuists consider the founder of Finland and the final nail of the dark forces of Stalin. Kekkonen during his rule revolutionised his lands in order to save Finland from obscurity. He is considered the patron of Finland and Finns everywhere owe their existence to his actions, so his followers attempt to emulate his charity and selflessness.;;;;;;;;;x
the_white_death;The White Death;;;;;;;;;x
the_white_death_desc;This character is emulating the White Death, a pre-Event warrior known for his swiftness, silence, and the ability to kill in a split second without ever being discovered. Said to be a one man army, details of the White Death's life have been lost to time. However, all accounts of his tenacity in combat leave him remembered as the greatest warrior Finland has ever seen and therefore the very embodiment of sisu, becoming one of the most popular figures in Sisuism.;;;;;;;;;x

america2Title;The Redcoats Embark;;;;;;;;;x
america2Desc;Having spent the last year gathering soldiers and preparing ships and supplies, the Redcoats are finally ready to embark on their voyage to America. The first ships left port this morning, following mariners' charts, and hope to report back within a few years.;;;;;;;;;x
america2A;We wish them a safe and speedy voyage;;;;;;;;;x
america2B;May they drown on the way;;;;;;;;;x 
america2C;Who?;;;;;;;;;x

america3Title;Fall of The Rockers;;;;;;;;;x
america3Desc;Word comes from the West! The Redcoats have landed in the place called 'Newfindland', it appears to be a large Island off the North East Coast of the Mainland. There, they have found but a squabbling bunch of barbarians, speaking strange dialects roughly reminiscent of the various languages of the British Isles, though such barbarians can't possibly speak the Queen's tongue. They have subjugated them, and brought them back under the Crown's dominion. Though the Rockers fought back, resistance was less than expected. Perhaps the reconquest of America is not such a far-fetched dream after all?;;;;;;;;;x
america3A;Rule Britannia!
america3B;The British are coming!;;;;;;;;;x
america3C;This is not our business;;;;;;;;;x
america3D;Excellent. Order them to go West along the great river;;;;;;;;;x
america3E;Excellent. Order them to focus on going South along the coastline;;;;;;;;;x

america4Title;The Crawling Chaos;;;;;;;;;x
america4Desc;Word comes from the West! The Redcoats arrived in America several months ago, but to their great surprise, they discovered that the land of Newfindland was held by an enormous realm, stretching across onto the Canadian mainland. The ruler of this realm has rallied his warriors, and the Redcoat forces have been shattered. In disarray, they have been utterly wiped out.;;;;;;;;;x
america4A;What a disaster!;;;;;;;;;x
america4B;Ha! Serves them right!;;;;;;;;;x
america4C;And the weather report?;;;;;;;;;x

america5Title;Reinforcements;;;;;;;;;x
america5Desc;The messengers who recently told us of the Redcoats' victories across the sea have also carried an appeal directly from the Lord-Admiral. It claims that, though their soldiers have fought bravely and victory was achieved, it was not achieved without substantial cost. America is obviously far more heavily populated than we had anticipated, and the Redcoats' arrival is sure to unite the troublesome colonials together in opposition to them. The Lord-Admiral therefore pleads for more supplies and soldiers to be sent to their new capital in Newfindland, warning that without reinforcements, future victory remains uncertain.;;;;;;;;;x
america5A;They shall have it. Load the ships!;;;;;;;;;x
america5B;They are just greedy cowards. What they have already is quite sufficient;;;;;;;;;x
america5C;You shouldn't tag over to e_redcoats, you know! This option is only for the AI, silly!;;;;;;;;;x

america6Title;Redcoats land in the Mainland;;;;;;;;;x
america6Desc;The Redcoats fresh from their victory in Newfindland have decided to start their campaign in the mainland through taking the area known as 'New Brunswick', the Redcoats have met little organized resistance from the locals and what seems like a legation army from the American heartland. Now the Redcoats have confidently secured a beachhead in the American mainland and are ready to march south.;;;;;;;;;x
america6A;The ancient slight is avenged;;;;;;;;;x
thelemaresponse;Rule Britannia!;;;;;;;;;x

america7Title;A Disastrous Repeat;;;;;;;;;x
america7Desc;The Redcoats have landed in the land known as 'New Brunswick' completely unopposed, but upon marching through the surroundings of the city of Moncton, they were ambushed by native forces and a few soldiers presumably from the American heartland, the Redcoats were caught by surprise in highly unfavourable terrain and were forced to surrender and retreat..;;;;;;;;;x

theravada_mahabodhi;Mahabodhi;;;;;;;;;x
theravada_mahabodhi_desc;Mahabodhi or the Great Bodhi Tree was a huge tent term derived from pre Kali-Yuga organisations that coordinated communication between all sects of Buddhism in the subcontinent, but after the Event the connections between them were severed and so the term now refers to Theravada schools that are either still open to reconciliation between different schools, or simply didn't quite fit into any other defined school. ;;;;;;;;;x
theravada_bodhidharma;Bodhidharma;;;;;;;;;x
theravada_bodhidharma_desc;Bodhidharma or Rule of Bodhi is a radical strain of the Theravada school of Buddhism that believes unity and zeal will get them through the Kali-Yuga. They believe that the chaos and uncertainty of this era are brought about by the irresoluteness and sinful tendencies of their forefathers, which broke the foundation of human civilization and tore a rift for Mara to lay waste on the world of living. The adherents of this sect aim to be forthright and unrelenting in their zeal and are not afraid to wage war to uphold their moral codes.;;;;;;;;;x
theravada_vispassana;Vispassana;;;;;;;;;x

osvicenism_virgin_mary;Creed of Mary, Mother of Saviours;;;;;;;;;x
osvicenism_virgin_mary_desc;The Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Saviours, gave birth to Jesus and saved him from untimely demise by outsmarting the pagan who sought Jesus' death. Her love towards the Saviour of Mankind rivals that of God's love to mankind, and so, when she passed away, God himself made her the keeper of Eden so that she can stay with Jesus in all eternity.;;;;;;;;;x
osvicenism_lord_buddha;Creed of Buddha, Lord of The Saints;;;;;;;;;x
osvicenism_lord_buddha_desc;Prince Josaphat, commonly referred to as Lord Buddha, was a Romani Prince who received guidance from Jesus himself, instructed to attain enlightenment and then guide others towards it. In life, he was a saviour to the downtrodden in the east. In death, instead of leaving Samsara, he opted to become an angel and guide others toward the path of wisdom as he did in life.;;;;;;;;;x
osvicenism_jesus;Creed of Jesus Christ, the Saviour;;;;;;;;;x
osvicenism_jesus_desc;Osvicenists are no strangers to the veneration of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the Son of God. However, due to the syncretic nature of their religion, some Osvicenists emphasise the Christian aspects of their religion, closely following the Bible and largely being unrecognisable from other Christians in their private worship.;;;;;;;;;x

budaist_skyfather;Sky-Father;;;;;;;;;x
budaist_skyfather_desc;The Sky Father or Tengri is an ancient deity venerated by some people of the steppes. While many Budaists view those with disdain, a small portion of them reserve a spot in their heart for him knowing that Budai once honoured this god and let him live after destroying the other pantheons.;;;;;;;;;x
budaist_savaka_stallion;Savaka Stallion;;;;;;;;;x
budaist_savaka_stallion_desc;The Savaka Stallion sect was originally formed by a group of raider converts. While Budais teaching encouraged peaceful resolution over violence, this is often considered impossible to faithfully adhere to due to the scarcity of resources and inherent wickedness within humans. The Savaka Stallion sect gladly burdened themselves with the matter of violence so that other Budaists could reach enlightenment easier.;;;;;;;;;x
budaist_arhat_budai;Arhat Budai;;;;;;;;;x
budaist_arhat_budai_desc;Arhat Budai is widely believed to have left his homeland after slaughtering a pantheon of local gods along the way for betraying Attila. He was then relieved of his worldly burden and achieved enlightenment on the spot, and while he left the steppes for India, his retainers stayed watching over Attilas tomb and tended to the tree that the Arhat himself sat upon. Those retainers would eventually become the ones who established this very school to honour the true and honest name of Arhat Budai.;;;;;;;;;x

vajra_vajra;Vajra;;;;;;;;;x
vajra_vajra_desc;The name "Vajra" refers to a legendary thunderbolt weapon made out of adamantine. It is said to be the weapon of choice of Indra, the King of the Devas. It also reflects Vajrayanas view on the nature of things, being translucent, pure, radiant, indestructible and indivisible. Due to this worldview, the followers of this sect seek to better themselves through esoteric tantric methods.;;;;;;;;;x
vajra_acharya;Acharya;;;;;;;;;x
vajra_acharya_desc;Acharya" or The Wise Instructor in Sanskrit is the spiritual successor of its namesake originating in the depths of China. The school found its way among the herders and grazers of the plains who couldnt afford to fast or abstain from slaughter. For them, these transgressions can be forgiven if done in order to survive, thus making Acharya very popular among the laity.;;;;;;;;;x

tham_siam;Cult of Sayam Devadhiraj;;;;;;;;;x
tham_siam_desc;Sayam Devadhiraj is considered to be the guardian of all Thai. It is said that before the event, this watchful protector had fended off many misfortunes that could have befallen upon Siam. Regrettably, the sinful Siamese didnt heed Buddhas teachings, causing  Mother Kali to wreak havoc upon the world. Today, many Thammayut regret the sins of their forefathers and will do anything to seek penance from the once-omnipresent guardian angel. ;;;;;;;;;x
tham_ksat;Cult of Ksats;;;;;;;;;x
tham_ksat_desc;The Cult of Ksats venerates the myriad of Siamese monarchs above all else. They believe that the King of Siam and his descendants are mandated to cleanse Siam of treason and dissent no matter how flimsy the reason may sound. Followers of this cult pledge undying loyalty to their Emperors.;;;;;;;;;x
tham_khru;Cult of Phra Khru;;;;;;;;;x
tham_khru_desc;The Cult of Phra Khru, unlike other Thammayut cults, rejects the inherent divinity of royalty. They claim that the King of Siam was once a mere servant of Buddha who reincarnated to foster his true teachings in the land of Siam. They believe that with enough determination and great deeds, one could become royal themselves and even ascend past the realm of mortality, as many wise Phra Khru already have.;;;;;;;;;x

america8Title;Victory in New England;;;;;;;;;x
america8Desc;The victory in New Brunswick has opened the way to march south towards the American heartland through the lands known to the Redcoats as New England. The Redcoats, wisely sticking to the coast have managed to reach the city of Portland and have successfully put it under siege by encircling it. Eventually Portland surrendered and the Redcoats marched into the city triumphantly. The Redcoats are now ready to march further south into the American heartland.;;;;;;;;;x
america8A;Remind me to build some proper roads in that country when this is over.;;;;;;;;;x

america9Title;Defeat in New England;;;;;;;;;x
america9Desc;Perhaps in a show of overconfidence after their easily gained win in New Brunswick, the Redcoats have decided to march into the American heartland through the lands known to them as New England. Upon reaching the city of Bangor, the Redcoats rested and prepared to march further south towards the heartland. But while marching southwards through a particularly dense forest, they were ambushed by the locals who took them out silently one by one and eventually Redcoat morale broke and they were forced to retreat back to Bangor where they were surrounded by an American relief force and were shattered in the ensuing battle.;;;;;;;;;x
america9A;Give me back my legions!;;;;;;;;;x

america10Title;A Stalemate in Boston;;;;;;;;;x
america10Desc;While the Redcoats have achieved valiant victories across the New World in New Brunswick and New England, it appears that they have finally met their objective.... and also their end, in the city of Boston, one of America's great cities. The enormous city's garrison has managed to hold out the Redcoats for 3 weeks and prevented the Redcoat fleet from cutting off its naval supply routes. Eventually an American army from the south has arrived to reinforce Boston, and the combined forces of that reinforcing army, the Boston garrison and a New Englander 'Acadian' army from the north have trapped the Redcoats outside of the city, the ensuing bloodbath had wiped out a large portion of the Redcoat army and they were forced to surrender. Having fought for so long and so impressively the Federal army decided to offer the redcoats a deal rather than slaughtering them, they may settle the Ohio territory in return for serving in the federal army in the future.;;;;;;;;;x

america11Title;Redcoats defeated outside Boston;;;;;;;;;x
america11Desc;While the Redcoats have achieved valiant victories across the New World in New Brunswick and New England, it appears that they have finally met their objective.... and also their end, in the city of Boston, one of America's great cities. The enormous city's garrison has managed to hold out the Redcoats for 3 weeks and prevented the Redcoat fleet from cutting off its naval supply routes. Eventually an American army from the south has arrived to reinforce Boston, and the combined forces of that reinforcing army, the Boston garrison and a New Englander 'Acadian' army from the north have trapped the Redcoats outside of the city, the ensuing bloodbath had wiped out the majority of the Redcoat army and they were forced to surrender.;;;;;;;;;x
america11A;What? No! This can't be happening!;;;;;;;;;x

america12Title;Victory in Quebec;;;;;;;;;x
america12Desc;The plan to sail down the great river, known to the locals as the Saint Lawrence river ended up leading to several battles between the Redcoats and fortified island cities across Lower Canada or 'Quebec' as it's known to the locals and Britannia's southern neighbour. Though the island cities of Quebec and Montreal were heavily defended, the Redcoats managed to starve them out by cutting off their supplies and dominating waters around them with their fleet, eventually forcing them to surrender.;;;;;;;;;x
america12A;It seems a lot has changed while we were away;;;;;;;;;x

america13Title;Quebec beats the Redcoats;;;;;;;;;x
america13Desc;The plan to sail down the great river, known to the locals as the Saint Lawrence river ended up leading to several battles between the Redcoats and the fortified island cities across Lower Canada or 'Quebec' as it's known to the locals and Britannia's southern neighbour. The cities dominating the river proved to be well suited for such an invasion from the sea that the Redcoats found themselves in a very tough position, relatively far from their base as Newfindland and unable to forage the land for further supplies, an eventual counterattack by the armies of Quebec forced the Redcoats to surrender.;;;;;;;;;x
america13A;I never thought Canadians could be so fierce!;;;;;;;;;x

america14Title;Ontario Retaken;;;;;;;;;x
america14Desc;The victories in lower Canada has opened the way to the 'Great Lakes', lakes so large that you can't see the other end in the horizon. The people who occupy the lands north of the lakes call themselves 'Ontarians' and are seemingly subject to the American government. After taking Kingston near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence, Redcoat forces moved in to secure south Ontario which led to pitched battles around Toronto and Hamilton. the Redcoat forces eventually decided to fortify their position upon reaching the Niagara River facing the heartland of America.;;;;;;;;;x
america14A;America here we come!;;;;;;;;;x

america15Title;Defeat in Ontario;;;;;;;;;x
america15Desc;It seems that the locals of the lands south of Lower Canada and the Americans became aware of the Redcoat invasion earlier than anticipated and have started gathering forces at the mouth of the Saint Lawrence near Kingston to counter them. Upon the arrival of the Redcoat fleet at Kingston, it was ambushed by an American fleet ;;;;;;;;;x
america15A;Those damned Canadians!;;;;;;;;;x

america16Title;Stalemate in Ohio;;;;;;;;;x
america16Desc;The Redcoats, having won costly victories in Ontario and having heard of a large American army across the Niagara river, have decided to instead march west and attack the land known as 'Michigan', after an exhausting siege in Detroit, a heavily diminished Redcoat army has found itself in the northern parts of a land known as 'Ohio' to the Americans. The Redcoats, in no position to retreat, were forced to give battle. Having fought for so long and so impressively the Federal army decided to offer the redcoats a deal rather than slaughtering them, they may settle the Ohio territory in return for serving in the federal army in the future.;;;;;;;;;x

america18Title;Rumblings and Rumors;;;;;;;;;x
america18Desc;It is over. The Redcoats have utterly lost control of their holdings in America, and they have been scattered to the four winds. Their soldiers have surrendered, some being absorbed into the civilian populace, others attempting to flee back across the Ocean, very few of whom will ever be seen again. The few survivors tell harrowing stories of American savagery and vengeance, hounded by the fear that the demons of the New World will not leave them be, but will pursue them back home...;;;;;;;;;x
america18A;They could never bring such a big force over the ocean! Right..?;;;;;;;;;x

america19Title;The Wind Comes From The West;;;;;;;;;x
america19Desc;Some years ago, the Redcoats invaded the distant and fabled land of America. Their invasion ultimately failed, and little has been heard from there ever since. But now, the worst fears of the Redcoat survivors have been realised - the Americans, galvanised by the shock of the British invasion, and realising that the world beyond the Atlantic is within range of colonisation, and having spent several years building a fleet of ships, have launched a great invasion of the Old World. Their armies have already landed near the Orkneys, in Scotland, and they have unfurled their banner, declaring their intent to establish an American hegemony upon this world.;;;;;;;;;x

america20Title;The Redcoats Set Sail;;;;;;;;;x
america20Desc;Everyone has heard the legends of the great British Empire, and of the glory that was hers long ago, before the world broke. But of all the lands of the Crown that were lost, the fabled America has always been foremost in the minds of the British. Myths tell of the expulsion of The Queen's forces from America by the demon Washington, and though Her Majesty's forces recovered from this defeat, they never reclaimed those far lands. Recently, this ancient defeat has been much on the mind of the Grandmaster of the Redcoats, who has gathered a large number of soldiers and set off for the far distant land, hoping to conquer it for the Crown once more.;;;;;;;;;x
america20A;May the Queen grant them victory;;;;;;;;;x
america20B;Good riddance;;;;;;;;;x
america20C;Lunatics!;;;;;;;;;x

america21Title;Fading Into Memory;;;;;;;;;x
america21Desc;Several years ago, the Redcoat Dominion crossed the roaring Atlantic and invaded mysterious America. The last anyone heard of them was five years ago, by which point they had been defeated decisively and settled in the Ohio territory. As such all contact with them has been effectively lost and only through contact with Arhavi merchants have we uncovered that their settlement of Ohio by the Federalist government seems to have proceeded without issue.;;;;;;;;;x

Heavily influenced by the classics of Taoism, they are very respectful of natural order and hierarchy. They believe that the fundamental human vice is selfishness, which is caused by the illusory belief in individual selves, and the fundamental human virtue is universal compassion, which is caused by the recognition that we are all parts of one transpersonal reality. Failing to have compassion for another person is like ignoring a wound to one's own limb because it is temporarily numb.;;;;;;;;;x

At first the ballad is idiom-heavy, but you can understand that it speaks of some children, playing war and chivalric battles among themselves, without understanding its full implementations, with the point-of-view voice speaking as one of those children, condemning themselves for their misdeeds. Ballad then presumably mentions a deity called Voronyo, a giant murder of crows, who followed the children anywhere they would go. Then suddenly the voice starts talking to the audience directly and warns you not to repeat their mistakes. You start thinking the Ballad may have something to do with the Deluge...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECOURTE.6924;Ballad about a Deer.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOURTE.6924;You start hearing jumpy, though tragic Gitara music. You hardly understand what song is about in essence because of a language barrier, but you are somehow managing to grab individual phrases. Song is speaking of the Deer, a primordial deity of some kind. Deer is depicted running through the empty city, bringing the people to the other world, where both existing and not existing live. The Point-of-View character longs for the deer, whishes him to come back and take him to that world. You are not sure about the true meaning of this Ballad.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECOURTE.6925;Ballad about Time.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOURTE.6925;Bard takes his Gitara and starts to play melodic and slow lyrics-heavy ballad. At first you cant fully grasp the sense of the piece, but you understand certain phrases and idioms. You hear of a long-abandoned castle, speaking up about jousts, sieges and archery that happened in the time long past. It speaks of steel, shattering from the sword impact, bowstring, smoking from tension and The Death itself, sitting on the armies' spears. About True Love and High Treason. The Main character of the song asks you of perpetual validity of such concepts as Love, Evil and Good. The ballad then sings about the time itself, and how even in a days old gone there where always some constant, unchanging concepts. You are staring to thing this ballad might be a moral testament of pre-deluge Rodina...;;;;;;;;;x

nistr1title;The Rump Empire;;;;;;;;;x
nistr1desc;Among the empires of Europe Transnistria is one of the only among them which can trace it's origins to before the event. It had taken many forms throughout the years, first a tribe under the legendary Smirnovescu chiefs. Then, after a brief period of foreign rule, the nistrenian people revolted and established a stratocratic republic, with revolting army's generals becoming the new rulers of the realm. The Nistrenian Republic grew far and wide, eventually encompassing the whole kingdom of moldavia. Though the stratocracy was eventually replaced by the Transnistrian Empire under the Saint Empress Adriana, the State still remained, growing in Size to eventually incorporate most of the lands from Danube and Carpathians on the west to Volga and Caucasus to the east. Everything changed when Imparatul Octavian of the Portucaliu dynasty died without leaving a heir. The resultant crisis took a heavy toll on the Empire. Destabilized and reduced thrice in size, with the Korol of Ukraine growing greater in strength. The Empire is now on the verge of complete dissolution, the Dragos Imparatuls sitting on the throne must ensure the reformation of the mere rump state into the proper Empire it once was.;;;;;;;;;x

nistr211title;War-Torn State;;;;;;;;;x
nistr211desc;You were approached by your chancellor yesterday. He warned you that this civil war we are embroiled in is taking a heavy toll on our realm's already fragile stability, as local lords become more and more radicalized into supporting one of two sides. After you accused him of high treason, he was quick to reaffirm your that your cause is of course righteous. However our nation should better finish this war swiftly or else the consequences could be disastrous.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nistr211;He might sound treasonous, but I wonder if he is right...;;;;;;;;;x
nistr221title;Overexpansion;;;;;;;;;x
nistr221desc;You were approached by your chancellor yesterday. He warned you that the rate with which our realm is expanding could be damaging to our stability. Our military grows less and less efficient at managing the realm, leading the local lords all over our state to neglect you as a ruler and become more independent. He then added that while your realm conquering nearby states is certainly a good change, yet we probably should slow our pace and reorganise our military if we want it to stabilize.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nistr221;He might sound like a traitor, but I wonder if he is right...;;;;;;;;;x

nistr231title;A Bad Emperor?;;;;;;;;;x
nistr231desc;You were approached by your chancellor yesterday. He had raised concerns about your... way of governing the state. Although his way of speech had been very lubricous, constantly wandering around into metaphors and excuses, you can still understand that what he is talking about is you, not doing a good enough job at being an Imparatul. He briefly mentions your skills as a diplomat and a steward being rather lacking and your vassals starting to doubt your authority over them. He finishes off by explaining that if this processes are to continue- Transnnistria would faced with disastrous consequences.;;;;;;;;;x

nistr21title;Collapse of the Transnistrian Empire!;;;;;;;;;x
nistr21desc;The Transnistrian Empire, the great nation once spanning from Danube to Caspian sea that had dominated political shape of the Eastern Europe for over two hundred years is now in shambles. The Empire itself is long removed from the years of its zenith, but only recently had the situation there deteriorated significantly. The Dragos dynasty, originally installed on the throne by a coalition of Transnistrian nobles as a compromise to end the succession crisis, had not brought onto their promises of peace and stability. Instead, opting to do the exact opposite - they rose up in rebellion, beginning another civil war. Polarization of the nobles towards one of two camps, as well as general disenchantment with strong imperial authority have led most vassals to declare themselves independent and the Empire was thus dissolved.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nistr21;Truly a great loss for all of us.;;;;;;;;;x

The Empire itself is long removed from the years of its zenith, but only recently had the situation there deteriorated significantly. After a brief period of reckless expansion, Transnistria had experienced a complete inability to manage not only its newly conquered lands, but the crown ones as well. To defend themselves from rampaging peasant uprisings and bandit raids, local lords started to rely more and more on themselves and less and less on the Imparatul. This, in turn, had left the Imparatul's powers and authority almost nonexistent, eventually leading to them abandoning him altogether and de-facto dissolving the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x

The Empire itself is long removed from the years of its zenith, but only recently had the situation there deteriorated significantly. A relatively long period of stabilization was undone by a single unskilled and arbitrary Imparatul. His arbitrary actions and lack of an ability to solve Imperial issues, convinced the local lords, his vassals, eventually becoming disenchanted with the concept of a single imperial authority, leading them to abandon the empire altogether, de-facto dissolving it.;;;;;;;;;x

nistr3title;Empire Stabilized;;;;;;;;;x
nistr3desc;The Transnistrian Empire, the great nation once spanning from Danube to Caspian sea that dominated the political shape of Eastern Europe over a century ago had not been in a great situation lately. Portucaliu, the orange dynasty that brought The Empire to its zenith had died out when Octavian, the last Imparatul died in battle in Grozny. After his death, multiple people claimed the throne, and so, with the ensuing civil war the downfall had began. It only ended half a century later, when Patriarch Carol deposed Imparatul Mihai and crowned his son, a compromised figurehead, as the new Imparatul. Ieremia and the Imparatuls after him have had a hard job to do - to rebuild, unify and solidify Transnistria. And while not all problems in the Empire have been solved, it can be said for sure that they did their job, and did it well.;;;;;;;;;x

Ieremia and his successors did an astonishing job though, they destroyed the Korolevstvo of Ukraine, whose rulers had opposed Imparatuls from the Empire's inception and crystallized a broken rumped system into a new, far stronger one. The fate of eastern Europe is now truly lying in the hands of the Imparatul.;;;;;;;;;x

Thus throwing the Empire into decades long period of civil war and instability, of which it came up as a broken rump state. No more should it be like that, as Imparatul [GetFullName] and his predecessors have reformed Transnistria, destroying all obstacles on the way back to greatness!;;;;;;;;;x

nistr100title;Sche ne vmerla Ukraïna!;;;;;;;;;x
nistr100desc;Ukraine as a post-deluge kingdom had a bumpy history. Originally united in 2210 by Borys Stovbur, a chief from the city of Poltava, it later grew in size immensely, conquering not only all of the Ukrainian, but the Belarusian land as well. On Ukraïna's territorial peak Tsisar Bohdan even formed an Empire- Tsisarstvo of the Grand Ruthenia. Shamefully, the Empire didn't last for long, as Bohdan was killed be Imparataesa Adriana of the growing Transnistrian Empire. Bohdans realm was split between his two sons, Roman ruling in Belarus and Panas in Ukraine. Eventually Panas swear loyalty to the Imparateasa, to keep Ukraine from complete collapse. This was a crucial decision, as the Kingdom of Ukraine later became a major part of the Empire's history, strongly influencing its politics and even partaking in major civil wars. Nowadays, at the end of the rescent succession crisis, Ukraine came up at the top, as Korol Hryhoriy Kobzar had united with Patriarch Carol to stop the turmoil, instlling Patriarch's son, Ieremia as the ne Imparatul, a figurhead for the two. Would Ukraïna come up on top of this alliance, or will it finally be dissolved in the Transnistrian Empire?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nistr100;Slava Ukraïni!;;;;;;;;;x
nistr101title;Ukrainer Imparatul?!;;;;;;;;;x
nistr101desc;To say that Ukrainers were rather salty about losing their Empire to the transnistrians would surely an understatement. Nationalistic and separatist sentiments are high, while the general conformity to the Imparatul is low. Though Korol of Ukraine could not not share their sentiments, his status as a representative figure for the ukrainers informaly forbids him from becoming the Imparatul. Or at least forbade, as [GetDynName], King of Ukraine became one. Should he adhere to the will of his people and search a new destiny, or should he comply the imperial aristocracy or abandon his ukrainer origins?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nistr101;I'm first and foremost a Ukrainer. Destroy the dire Empire!;;;;;;;;;x

nistr102title;Empire ruined by an Emperor.;;;;;;;;;x
nistr102desc;From the inception of the Transnistrian empire Ukrainers and Moldovans have been at each-other's throats, as Transnistria had defeated Grand Ruthenia and shattered it, vassalizing Ukraine. Recently though a major piece of news had reached our realm. Korol of Ukraine, after becoming the Imparatul had decided to completely shatter the Transnistrian Empire! The nobles of the realm couldn't have done much, as the vile Imparatul had a total control over the military, ordering to murder most of them at sight. Korol now bravely gazes into the future, as Transnistria is now becoming a mere thing of the past.;;;;;;;;;x

nistr104title;Ecumenical Patriarch takes over!;;;;;;;;;x
nistr104desc;After the Transnistrian Empire collapsed, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, historically subservient to the empire, felt a lack of authority. The Patriarchate needed to take ecclesiastical orders from a secular ruler, but without an emperor there is no-one giving orders. That's why The Ecumenical Patriarch decided to declare full independence, by usurping the heartlands of what once was The Empire of Transnistria. Most other Patriarchs, including the Georgian and Ukrainian, have accepted this. With the central authority of Orthodoxites now independent, their autonomy would surely increase.;;;;;;;;;x
