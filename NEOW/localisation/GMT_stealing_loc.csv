EVTTOOLTIPAGMT.001;will join you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.001;[Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledFirstName], my spymaster will assist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.001;More...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDGMT.001;I've decided against this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.002;Who will accompany you in the heist? It shall begin once the preparations are completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.002;My friend will assist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.002;My lover will assist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.002;[Root.Heir.GetTitledFirstName], my heir will assist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDGMT.002;More...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAGMT.007;You have arrived at the target, [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName]'s capital, as is to be expected it's guarded. There's a group of guards at the entrance, a servant's passage near the back, and a window close to the stables that is open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.007;We'll persuade servants to let me in;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.007;We'll duel our way inside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.007;We'll sneak in through the window;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.008;You have failed! The guards quickly start surrounding you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.008;Beg for forgiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.008;Fight my way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.008;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAGMT.051;You've managed to evade most patrols until you come up outside the treasury. Two tired guards stand between you and your prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.051;We'll duel them before they raise the alarm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.051;Pose as a servant and give them poison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.051;Use your Antediluvian knowledge to create a noxious gas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDGMT.051;One of us will try to seduce them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.052;Failed! You weren't as crafty as you thought, the guards draw their swords and approach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBGMT.052;Fight my way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.052;Quickly! Out the window!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAGMT.101;Now that the guards are dealt with, you're free to search the treasury for the target target. Time is short and the treasury is filled with documents, jewels, and many miscellaneous items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.101;Search frantically making too much noise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.101;Split up to cover more ground;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.101;Carefully search for the item;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDGMT.101;Time to get unconventional!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.102;You have taken too long and guards discovered you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.102;Surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.102;Duel them all, however there's a lot of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.102;Demand an audience with their liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESAGMT.150;During the escape you leave a calling card,insulting your foe based on their greatest failings. You take great pride in managing to steal one fine artifact for your collection and your target will soon find that fact out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.150;That went better than I thought;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAGMT.151;Your guards storm into your court, one speaks "My liege, we have failed you! One of your artifacts has gone missing!". [From.GetTitledName] the Gentleman Thief has made off with one of your artifacts and left a calling card insulting you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.151;This is treason! Now show me it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.151;Damn [From.GetHerHim]. Now show me it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCGMT.151;Curse [From.GetHerHim]. Now show me it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDGMT.151;Why doesn't my liege do something?! Show me it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEGMT.151;All the realm shall know! Now show me it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAGMT.200;You've failed in your heist, and now suffer the shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.200;It could have been worse I suppose;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.201;Your guards have caught [From.GetTitledName] trying to steal one of your artifacts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAGMT.201;To the dungeons with the traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBGMT.201;To the dungeons with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAGMT.300;Damn [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.300;To [ROOT.GetHerHim], Pig of lust. Your wanton and insatiable desire for all things carnal stain the lands you rule. Your whims that bring fear into the hearts of lords and ladies from your court, to the back halls of Nigeria are known to all. Your golden words that bear many faces which enrapture those you prey upon can no longer shield you, for I have stolen away your wealth, your idols, your power over those you cast your tyrannical pleasure upon. Sincerely, a Gentleman Thief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.301;To [ROOT.GetHerHim], Cow of Gluttony. Your hunger for all things has guided your callus rule. Under which it has created pain want want across those under your charge. Shortages of food and drink in times of plenty lead to rumors of a Tyrant for all to hear. For this I have chose you as my target. I have stolen from you your coffers, your grain stores. I have hollowed your larders to return to those you robbed dry of life and sustenance. Sincerely, a Gentleman Thief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.302;Addressed formally to [ROOT.GetHerHim], great collector and amasser of all things material. With the taxes you levy upon what you claim your own coffers flow over, like a parasite sucking their host dry. Your treasure halls run rampant as voids pulling deep possessions you cling to. No more shall this be so and no more shall it stand. With this letter I send out a call to all in your court and bound to you that they shall not live in poverty to sate your selfish needs. Every last coin has been reaped from you, so that you may feel the burden you yourself delivered. Every last treasure has been taken and given new life away from your gaudy chambers. Eagerly, a Gentleman Thief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.303;To the oaf [ROOT.GetHerHim], akin to a feline fed it's weight twice a day. Spending your years lazing about without a worry in your mind, uncaring of the events around you. Fickle and cold like any self absorbed egotist. I have stolen away what you have obtained by no merit of your own, one who only gathers and gives nothing. For what you have is better spent by the lowest of wench than in your idle fist. Sincerely, a Gentleman Thief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.304;May this find [ROOT.GetHerHim], a pettier than an ill-bred babe. Too occupied with what others have to make do with what your bottomless desire has pulled in, you pull down your whole court and that they govern too. Such worthless your collection is I hardly see it fit to steal it from you, yet when I imagine the coffers swiped away from your feeble grasp it fills me with a sense of euphoria at the idea of the ensuing tantrum. So I have taken away your petty treasures and bobbles, and given to those who are far more worthy. Sincerely, a Gentleman Thief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.305;In hope this finds [ROOT.GetHerHim], should they be unable to read it themselves. To the hotheaded boar who grips tightly all under their control. From you I have taken all that allows your madness to be made manifest, All that grants you the power to break those weaker than you for your own desire, and all that allows your petty squabbles. This has been done not for myself, but to free those under your iron grip. Regards, a Gentleman Thief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.306;To [ROOT.GetHerHim], boorish peacock. To see one amass such spoils for the sake of spoiling themselves is quite the show. If it were put on display I would gladly spend my wealth to pelt as many rotten items as I could. What is yours shall never again be, all your preened feathers and exuberant struts will be done in emperor's clothes. These things you waste given to those who can prove their industry with it. So I have done for the world, and be rid of one more pitiful louse. a Gentleman Thief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAGMT.314;This card is to find [ROOT.GetHerHim], the great Icon of sin upon Earth, whose desires transform them into malefic fiends that feast on the innocent and weak. Your transgressions are many and the extortion of your fellow man sicken all who gaze upon you. For this vile tyranny I have taken away what you find precious and dear, leaving you bare of power and influence to continue your rampage across the land. No more will your villainy stand, making amends is too late. Prepare yourself for this is not the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
