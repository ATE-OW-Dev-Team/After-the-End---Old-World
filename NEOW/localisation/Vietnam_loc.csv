thuyhoa_pagan_DESC;Thuy Hoa is a shamanistic religion that traces its origins back to the powerful elemental kings of the Cham. The followers of this faith venerate the elements of flame and water personified - the mediums Sdet Fai and Sdet Nam. The mediums' families have held sway over the Annamese highlands for millennia, claiming to have once held all of Asia under their sway. Nowadays, the Thuy Hoa find themselves besieged by the powerful Buddhist empires surrounding them, and only time will tell if they can rule the continent once more, or die trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

satsana_pi_pagan_DESC;Satsana Pi was once a spiritualist faith collectively practiced by the Tai, the people who graze the fertile yet backward plains of Northwestern Vietnam. They once venerated more benign spirits and kept their practice behind closed doors, having been abused by many overlords over the course of history, be it disrespecting their spirits, enslaving their shamans or the destruction of entire villages. The most despicable crime they committed, however, was the murder of Lord Thaen's consort, the Goddess of Rice, Mae Khwan Khao, causing the unspeakable calamity that shook the earth and destroyed the realm of their oppressors. The radical elements of the faith took this chance to raise dissent among the rest of the Tai, having been inspired by their more prosperous brethren in the south and communion from Lord Thaen who supposedly called for the blood of the people who murdered his consort. Time will tell if this demand will be realised or if the Tai will revert to their more pacifistic nature again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hmongism;Kev Dab Qhuas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hmongism_DESC;Kev Dab Qhuas, roughly translating to The Spirit of Praise is a folk religion practiced by the Hmong and Miao peoples of Southern China and Southeast Asia. It is a polytheistic and animistic faith, worshipping many different deities, such as Nplooj Lwg, the frog who created Heaven and Earth and Yaj Yuam, the Heavenly Archer. The chief deity role in the Hmong folk religion has eventually been overtaken by Txiv Yawg, commonly identified as Chiyou, whom they consider their king and liberator from the tyrannical rule of the Red and Yellow Emperors. Respect between people and spirits also plays a large role in Hmong theology, and as such they venerate many ancestral and nature spirits. Both before and after the Event, Hmong beliefs have been of a very syncretic nature, incorporating many beliefs from neighbouring religions, mainly Buddhism and Taoism. Today, the Hmong faith stands as a highly adaptable religion, with its adherents frequently adding foreign religious rituals to their own ancestral faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that before Ho's time, Vietnam was a dark, corrupt land, divided amongst itself and besieged by foreigners. However, Uncle Ho, a force of divinity, soon came to the land to banish the forces of darkness and imperialism, bringing liberty and light to the people of Vietnam. In retaliation, warlocks cursed the lands of Vietnam, seeping corruption into their soil and water for all eternity. Uncle Ho promised to watched over his people until his ascension into Heaven, leaving behind many teachings of justice, charity and progress to his followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
