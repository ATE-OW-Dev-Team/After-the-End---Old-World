###NOBELIAN EVENTS###,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nobelian1Desc;The secrets of the ancients are many and deep. Plumbing their mystic depths is very difficult even for the most dedicated scholar. Yet, if I ever wish to be counted among the wisest scholars, I must delve nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian1;I will search for a mentor to help me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian1;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian1;My mentor will aid me on the difficult path.;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian2Desc;You have discovered a mystical scholar belonging to a small monastic order, who would be of use to you in your studies. However, the Order is reluctant to let them go, for their loss would be a significant blow to the community.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian2;I'll pay his weight in gold!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian2;I'm sure I can persuade them to part;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian2;How can the Order refuse one of such august blood as I?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_nobelian2;On second thought, this isn't worth THAT much to me.;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian3Desc;"My men have returned with a skilled scholar and mystic. They've agreed to serve me," but only on the condition that I "promise to give them whatever they desire"," without exception" at an unspecified future date.";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian3;What's the worst that could happen?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian3;Are you insane?;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian4Desc;My search party has returned with a skilled scholar-mystic. However, the price they are asking is? rather extreme. They seem to demand a piece of my own flesh to serve me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian4;If this is the price of immortal wisdom...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian4;Get away from me and my family. By God, exile this freak!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian5Desc;I will delve into the mysteries of the [Root.GetReligion] religion, and bring wisdom back from the Old World to the benighted modern man. As I enter the sacred sauna, the attendants prepare the special herbs, as I prepare to divine the will of God.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian5;A Master like me can be assured of success.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian5;My learning gives me confidence, but success is never certain.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian5;Here goes nothing.;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian6Desc;Success! Inspiration strikes you, as ideas flow into your mind from beyond. Hopefully you can remember more than a few fragments of this afterwards.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian6;Praise God!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian7Desc;As the sacred steam fills your lungs, your head swims with otherworldly visions. But these do not reveal useful secrets, but horrifying and unsettling images. You scream, clutching at the sides of the door, trying to escape. Perhaps you will learn something from this, but even if you do, it will be a high price to pay for knowledge.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian7;Help Me!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian8Desc;As you prepare to enter the sacred sauna, your Mentor stops you. They've heard of several rare ingredients that can enhance the sacred steam such that it is far more likely to yield success, but it will cost money to find and gather these ingredients. They strongly advocate spending the time and money, however, claiming that your time will be spent much more fruitfully if you do.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian8;Purchase them, then;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian8;You are just trying to get more money for yourself! How about you do the job I pay you for?;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian9Desc;The European continent was once the land of knowledge and God, a land where men listened to his word and were enlightened by it. You have decided that you should go on a pilgrimage to the ancient sites of Europe, hoping there to uncover some fragment of Ancient knowledge, thought lost to time. But where shall you travel? Each region may yield different fruit.;;;;;;;;;x

nobelian10Desc;The European continent was once the land of knowledge and God, a land where men listened to his word and were enlightened by it. You have decided that you should go on a pilgrimage to the ancient sites of Europe, hoping there to uncover some fragment of Ancient knowledge, thought lost to time. But where shall you travel? Each region may yield different fruit.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian10;Eastern Europe, fierce and free.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian10;The South of Europe, beautiful but troubled.;;;;;;;;;x

nobelian11Desc;You have arrived safely and without event. As your small team of retainers and laborers disembarks from the ship, you gaze into the horizon, wondering what wonders await you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian11;Forwards!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian13Desc;As you disembark from your ship, you notice a group of colorfully-robed officials coming by to accost you. Behind them stands a line of soldiers. It seems that the local lord of this place has demanded that you pay him tribute for the right of passing through his domain.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian13;Pay up - arguing isn't worth the trouble;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian13;Abandon the expedition and turn back home;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian13;Negotiate a smaller bribe;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_nobelian13;Sneak past the guards and officials.;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian14Desc;Disaster! A group of local bandits has surrounded your party and are demanding your money! The group looks ragged and poorly-trained, but it is doubtful that a force as small as yours can resist them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian14;Fight them off - they will scatter before a determined charge!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian14;Take my gold, but spare my life!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian14;Run away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_nobelian14;Oh, you think you're scary? I'll show YOU scary!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian15Desc;Disaster! While inspecting the remains of an Old World building, your investigation team accidentally caused part of it to collapse! It will not be long before your entire team is buried under rubble!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian15;Run away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian15;Some quick thinking will save the day;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian15;Go in there yourself and make sure everyone gets out safely!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian16Desc;While traveling through this foreign country, you have stumbled across an artifact!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian16;Interesting!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian17Desc;While traveling through this foreign country, you have made contact with the many Vaesenite minorities and communities throught it. Last night, while staying at a small village, you met a promising youth possessed of many skills and a desire to see the world. He is now asking you to take him with you on your expedition, and after that, back to your court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian17;Of course!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian17;Another mouth to feed? I'd rather not bother.;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian18Desc;You set out to write down your Mystical Experiences and lay them forth in an orderly manner. While they may be gratifying to you personally, if they remain only within your own head, they are unlikely to help anyone else.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian18;Now my memory is preserved in ink and paper.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian18;Write an advanced Treatise;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian18;Create a powerful Totem;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_nobelian20;At last!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENOBEL22;Cold Fire;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian22Desc;The mist before your eyes clears, as the mystical trance you were in dissipates. You gaze upon your work and, for the first time, truly realise what it is you have wrought. This is the formula for Greek Fire! History would surely damn you forever if you were to re-introduce the world to this long-forgotten horror. And yet§You worked so hard on this... Surely all of this work cannot have been for naught?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian22;I?I must destroy this!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_nobelian22;I..I cannot! My name will be known, even if it is cursed!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_nobelian22;Hahahahah! Glorious!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENOBEL23;The Miracle of Medicine;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian23Desc;With a sudden flash, the burst of inspiration you were writing under disappears, and you pause to examine your work. Your heart nearly leaps into your mouth. You have rediscovered the secret to an Ancient medicine! Your name will live forever!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian23;At last!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENOBEL24;Wondrous Revelations;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian24Desc;You enter into a mystic trance, and an angel appears to you in a dream. He speaks to you of ancient wonders, explaining completely a topic of art and science by which men may be edified and uplifted. He bids you swiftly to wake and inscribe it down, before your memory fades. You are jarred awake and sit bolt upright, practically jumping out of bed. Motes of the dream escape from your memory practically every second, but you immediately write down as much of what you were told as you can remember. When it is done, you have before you the text of a great revelation - a piece, however incomplete, of the great truths known by God.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian24;Glorious!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian25Desc;The teaset you have assembled is dainty and beautiful. Tea is fairly hard to come by nowadays, but regardless of whether or not you ever use it, this item will surely make you the envy of many.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian25;Charming;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian26Desc;With great care and precision, you piece together the pieces of the arcane mechanism. Small sparks of electricity leap from its coils, tingling and exciting you.;;;;;;;;;x

nobelian32Desc;By combining many different fragments and analysing many different documents, you have managed to recreate a famous Beer recipe from the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_nobelian32;Cheers!;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian33Desc;Through piecing together its fragmentary pieces, you have managed to reconstitute an ancient text regarding the art of siege warfare. Though much of it is impossible to interpret, it will still be of great use to you.;;;;;;;;;x

##Jojo Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEJOJO1;The Phantom of Blood;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO1;You are Jonathan Joestar, only son of the noble George. When you were very young, a commoner saved your father's life, and in gratitude your father raised that man's son as his own. This was your adoptive brother, Dio Brando. Yet Dio did not show gratitude to his benefactor, but instead plotted to torment you and usurp your own life, even trying to poison your father and blame you for the crime! You recently discovered his duplicity and, with the aid of your new friend Robert Speedwagon, confronted him. He managed to escape, despite having been shot seemingly-fatally by crossbow bolts. Now, he has taken control of the small castle known as Knight's Lot, and is plotting some new nefarious scheme. You must stop Dio before he ruins any more lives!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.1;I'll make you cry like a baby, Dio!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO2;The End;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO2;After storming Dio's castle, you find your wicked half-brother gloating there, mocking you. "You're too late, Jojo!" he says. "I've already thrown away my humanity! Now I will live forever!" Unfazed, you draw your sword and swing mightily, cleaving a deep blow through his head! You've won! But then, to your shock, Dio begins to laugh. "Didn't I already tell you that I am no longer human?" To your amazement, he begins to push the two halves of his severed head back together, and they begin to heal! He grabs hold of you, and you begin to feel your strength draining out of you! Thinking quickly, you push forward, towards the edge of the high castle parapet that you are dueling on. Before he realises what is happening, you both tumble off, into the night. With your free hand, you grab onto a protruding tree branch, arresting your fall. Dio, his grip loosened by shock, plummets past you, screaming curses of eternal vengenace.;;;;;;;;;x ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_jojo.2;Goodbye, Dio.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO3;Jonathan has defeated you. Sunken deep into the ocean, you barely manage to survive by locking yourself inside a coffin. You will have to remain here, drifting at the mercy of the waves, until someone happens upon your sunken tomb. Until then, all you can do is wait, and brood.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.3;One day I will extinguish the Joestar bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO4;A Joyful Victory;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO4;Victory! With your triumph over your wicked half-brother Dio, you have avenged the death of your father and the Joestar family name. At last, you may have some peace and quiet, as is your reward. But what could Dio have meant when he said he was no longer human? Could he truly be still alive?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.4;If he ever returns, the Joestars will be ready.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO5;Stardust Crusaders;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO5;At last, the time has come. An African fisherman has fished up your floating coffin, and opened it. After swiftly killing him and his companions, you stretch out your body, stiff beyond measure after a century of confinement. Throughout the years, one thought alone has kept you sane - revenge on the Joestar bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAJOJO5;Do you believe in Gravity?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO6;The Memory of Your Bloodline;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO6;Out of nowhere, you feel a sudden chill, as if your whole body were suddenly blasted by a harsh winter wind. You ask the members of your family, and they also report that the same thing happened to them at the same time. Nobody else in your court was affected, only your family members. What could this ominous feeling mean?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.6;This dread runs in my very veins...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO9;Assassin Attack!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO9;It has been several months now since you felt that strange chill in your blood, and you had forgotten all about it. One day, while getting dressed, you notice one of the servants enter the room. You asked them to help you, but to your surprise, they drew a weapon on you! "Hail, Lord DIO! I do this for you!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.9;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_jojo.9;Trick them!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO10;The End;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO10;You struggle valiantly, but the assassin gets the better of you. As you feel the blade sink into your chest, you wonder why all of this had to happen...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.10;No...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO11;Reprieve;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO11;After a desperate struggle, you manage to throw off your attacker. Your guards arrive at last, and quickly dispose of the assassin.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.11;Thank goodness;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO12;Call To Adventure;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO12;The assassin's body has been disposed of, and normalcy is finally starting to return to the household. After several hours, a servant arrives, bearing an important message. He introduces you to a strange man that you don't recognise. \n "You don't know me, but I know you" he says. "Your ancestor, Jonathan Joestar, killed Dio Brando. But DIO was no longer mortal, he was something...different. After a hundred years, he has returned, and now his fanatical followers seek to exterminate you and everyone else who carries the Joestar blood. I can take you to DIO. This will never end until he is dead, but I will understand if you don't want to take the risk.";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.12;I will finish Jonathan's work!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_jojo.12;This is too dangerous. Let someone else do it!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO13;An Adventure Most Menacing;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO13;After a harrowing journey, you finally arrive at DIO's mansion in uptown Cairo. The place is filled with a dreadful, terrifying aura, and every step through it is filled with peril. At last, however, you find yourself at the base of a grand golden staircase. At the top, a huge, muscular figure looms in the shadows. \n "Oh, you're approaching me?" he says. You swallow your fear and respond. "I can't kill you without getting closer." He laughs. \n "Oho! Then come as close as you like!";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.13;This is your end, DIO!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO14;In DIO's World;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO14;DIO's movements are incredibly quick, he seems to appear and disappear with blinding speed. You only have a moment to attack!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.14;One chance is all I need!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO15;End of the World;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO15;In a split second, you see DIO leave a weak point open! You swing with all your might, and your blade strikes true! It bites deep into DIO's leg, causing him to stumble. "I-Impossible!" he cries. "I AM DIO!" You heave mightily, cleaving his entire leg in twain, before pulling your sword back and cutting his head clean off. With his leg crippled, he is unable to block. Strange black fluid pours out of his body, as the ageless DIO finally crumbles. You have finished Jonathan's work, and saved your entire bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.15;At last, it's over;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO16;Useless, Useless, Useless;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO16;You try to swing, but before you can so much as blink, DIO vanishes from your sight. He reappears behind you, and strikes you so hard that you are impaled through the chest by his arm. "Disappointing. I had hoped the Joestar bloodline would prove more of a challenge." Things go black as you collapse to the floor...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jojo.16;No...DIO..!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEJOJO17;Do You Believe in Gravity?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCJOJO17;Anyways gimme your foot so I can heal you.;;;;;;;;;x

sikh1Desc;You dress yourself in the five Sikh articles of faith, The five Pyare, wise men representing the 'beloved volunteers' who bravely followed the Guru into his tent when he created the way of the Khalsa, surround you and explain the meaning of following the Khalsa. You must swear never again to cut your hair, to eat the meat of any animal, to cohabit with anyone other than your spouse, or to use tobacco, alcohol, or any kind of drug. You swear to follow these stipulations throughout all of your life, and a sixth Sikh reads a randomly-chosen passage from the Guru Grant Sahib. You repeat the sacred salutation, and the Pyare mix pure water in an iron bowl using a ceremonial sword. You drink from the bowl, and are fully inducted into the Khalsa.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENOBEL39;Dreams of Dismal Moonlight;;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian39Desc;In your dreams tonight, a moth stirs, and lights upon your ear. It whispers, in a voice of satin and dark ice: "The Truth awaits you in the NORTH". An inexplicable feeling washes over you, and you gaze upward at the moon, and the moon looks back at you, and the moon's light reveals to you a hint, a scrap, a breadcrumb of knowledge, like the last snowflake on the grass at springtide. It says: \nDo not listen to him. That way is closed to all those who are mortal.";;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLENOBEL40;The First Gate: Gold;;;;;;;;;;x
nobelian40Desc;In your dreams, you stand before a Gate of Gold, hundreds of miles tall. There is a bitter, cold wind, and in the thunderous roar of midwinter silence, the voice returns to you. \n\n "Gild yourself" it says "for the key of the Gate of Treasons is the idolatry of the heart." A figure emerges from the Gate - a statue, a golden idol, embedded with gems, made in your own image. The voice says "Will you open the Gate?";;;;;;;;;;x

nobelian41Desc;In your dreams, you approach another Gate, made of ivory and white as the Moon-Bat's skin. You search in vain for an opening, but it is as smooth as sorrow, and as merciless as love. At last the Voice returns, and it says:\n\n "The Ivory Gate is the second and last of the Gates of Inanima. It will not let me pass, for my ancient crime, but you may, if you will destroy something of priceless value, something posterity will condemn you for.";;;;;;;;;;x

Before the great gate of mile-high teeth, the Corpusculent Sarcophage stands, his bloody hatchet held low. His eyeless face stares at you with the passionate intensity of a lover.;;;;;;;;;;x
String_ThirdGatePassed;Once again, you approach the Corpusculent Sarcophage, but this time it is different. He no longer looks at you with hunger, but with disgust. Wordlessly, he speaks to you: \n\n "Stop. Beyond this Gate lies only destruction and madness. Return to whatever life you still can, or know that you press on, to the Path of the Damned.";;;;;;;;;;x

Is this your first time in the House of Lies? Yes? No? Oh well, it doesn't really matter either way." \n\nHe produces a silver knife, and gestures to you to open your mouth. \n\n"Come, now. You're far too talkative to make it where you're going. If you won't let me fix it, you've got no chance.";;;;;;;;;;x

You seem to have stumbled upon the War Room, where Red and Blue generals alike pore over their battle plans. One of them calls to you: "It's about time we got some new blood! Tell us, soldier, what do you think?" You pore over their charts and begin to give advice, which they gratefully wrench from your mind and transfer onto their vast wax scrolls.";;;;;;;;;;x

"What are you doing in the War Room? Get back on the front lines, grunt!"Before you know what has happened, you find yourself dressed in a blue uniform, charging into battle.

You have proven a wastrel, but now you must prove a fool." You dutifully kneel, and it places its cold, dead hand on your brow. You feel yourself grow weaker, and the world grow more bewildering.;;;;;;;;;;x

But...what is this? Before you, you see a...is that a sheet? A piece of paper? You look, and are shocked to see your own face. Above it, it says "[Root.GetTitledNameWithNick]". What? Next to it, you see a symbol of paper, with a number: State Diplomacy: [Root.GetDiplomacy]. Small circles with symbols adorn the sheet.

secret_romuva_decision_desc;Our pagan ancestors used to say that certain wooded groves had special powers. One of these is located within your own lands. Though it would be scandalous, you could try to visit one - and perhaps you could excuse it as a hunting trip..?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCromuva1;I have decided to venture into the woods that the pagans hold as sacred, to see what the matter is with them. Now, the biggest question remains - should I go alone, or with others?;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCromuva2;You spend several hours navigating the paths of the forest, until you come upon a strange-looking old man by the side of a river.

EVTOPTBromuva2;A good story is always worth hearing!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCromuva3;The man tells you an enchanting story, one that seems to draw you in. You feel it resonate with you deeply, as if there is some deeper meaning to it.

EVTTITLEromuva6;Resurgence of the Romuva;;;;;;;;;;x
romuva6Desc;Over two centuries ago, Paulius Juze, a fervent and zealous Catholic knight, led a Crusade that ended in the overthrow of the pagan Mindaugasid kings of Lithuania. He and his descendants strongly suppressed paganism, and it nearly died out in its own country. Recently, however, [k_lithuania.Holder.GetTitledName] has reverted to the Old Faith, and as he has proved a strong ruler, he has proclaimed a new era for the old religion. Throughout the country, isolated enclaves of pagans are emerging from their caves, and enthusiasm for the religion is at an all-time high. Though the Catholics despise [k_lithuania.Holder.GetHerHim] for this, for the moment they cannot do anything about it. It remains to be seen if this return will last, or if this pagan monarch will meet the same fate as the last one.;;;;;;;;;;x

nistr42desc;Several Journeymen Gunsmiths and their associated fellow toolsmiths have arrived in the palace from Britain, offering to establish several workshops throughout Transnistria. The caveat is that the money for these workshops will have to come out of Transnistrian pockets until they are operational. They refuse to elaborate as to why they seemingly fled their homes in Britain. Regardless, it would be advantageous for our forces on the field of battle to field those guns. They also offer you an example of their work to keep, should you hire them.;;;;;;;;;x
