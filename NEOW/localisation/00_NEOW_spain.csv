DESC_renovatio_0001;The Spaniards of old were seemingly very far removed from the inhabitants of Spain today. It is said that all of Spain spoke in one tongue, that they wore exotic garments beyond the wildest dreams of even the Kings of today. Our finest scholars have reconstructed their language, and learned whatever they could of their traditions from the documents and relics that survived the Event. To claim legitimacy and assert our authority we could adopt the culture of this ancient people. It will be inconvenient to drastically change the traditions of the entirety of the empire, so there is always the option of maintaining the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPT_A_renovatio_0001;Let us embrace the culture of the Old World!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DESC_england_restored.0001;While antediluvian English fell out of regular use after the event, scribes and monks were still studying ancient texts of that language for centuries. Today, the restored Kingdom of England has issued a decree reinstituting antediluvian English as its official language, perhaps as a move to gain legitimacy as the proper successor to the ancient Kingdom of England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
