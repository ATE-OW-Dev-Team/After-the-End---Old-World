witcher10title;An Interesting Offer;;;;;;;;;x
witcher10desc;Recently a danish merchant has requested an audience with you to talk about a deal "You cannot reject". He claims to have the sword of the Witcher King, who has met his demise in his campaign against the kingdom of Denmark. Of course, it would be great to have such an artifact in our hands, but is there validity to his claim?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_witcher10;Give him a chance to prove its validity.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_witcher10;It's obviously a fake, send him away!;;;;;;;;;x
witcher11desc;The merchant is brought before you, showing you the sword and saying "I assure you m'lord, it's the real thing". As you and the council look over it, it is evident that it truly is. The hilt, the blade, the guard, all of it matches the legends told by the vedmaks, but the merchant asks for a steep price.;;;;;;;;;x
witcher11title;The Sword;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_witcher11;It's worth the price.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_witcher11;Alas, we cannot afford it.;;;;;;;;;x
witcher12desc;The merchant is brought before you, showing you the sword and saying "I assure you m'lord, it's the real thing". As you and the council look over it, you begin to think it really is real. The legends don't exactly match up, the blade is not as sharp and the guard is not as big, but legends are always excelerating a bit.;;;;;;;;;x
witcher12title;The Sword;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_witcher12;We can afford it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_witcher12;Alas, we cannot afford it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_witcher12;I am not convinced.;;;;;;;;;x
witcher121desc;As you have it examined closer by your Chief Diviner, they conclude that the sword you bought is nothing but a cheap immitation. Sadly, it's already too late, as the merchant has left your lands already to trade in the rest of the Baltic Sea, unlikely to ever return.;;;;;;;;;x
witcher121title;A fake;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_witcher121;Damn it!;;;;;;;;;x
witcher13desc;The merchant is brought before you, showing you the sword and nervously saying "I a-a-assure you m'lord, it's the real thing". As you and the council take a glance at it, you quickly notice the quality, or more like it's lack thereof. The blade could barely cut butter, the guard is wobbly and the hilt already has parts falling off of it. How shall we deal with this scammer?;;;;;;;;;x
witcher13title;The Sword?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_witcher13;I'll make sure you'll never scam another person ever again!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_witcher13;Confiscate his wealth as punishment.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_witcher13;Let him off the hook.;;;;;;;;;x
