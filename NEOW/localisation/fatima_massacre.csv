EVTTITLE_AEC_1001;Pilgrimage to Fátima;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AEC_1001;The whole [fatima_religion.GetName] world is preparing for the upcoming crusade. This not only involves brave knights training for the upcoming battles and charitable merchants repairing their old ships. A group of zealots, with the approbation of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick], are organizing a grand pilgrimage to Fátima to get the blessing of [fatima_religion.GetRandomGodName] on the upcoming war. They are gathering in [fatima_current_province.GetName]. Hundreds of faithfuls from all over Eastern Europe have already arrived there, ready to move on to Italy.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AEC_1002_A;The [fatima_religion.GetName] pilgrims' journey to Italy was fast and smooth. They successfully arrived at [fatima_current_province.GetName]. On the way, even more believers of [fatima_religion.GetRandomGodName] have joined them. They never lack of anything because the lords and ladies of the European nobility made some generous donations, a couple of them also faces the difficulties of travelling with them. Their next step will be setting on boats and moving to Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_AEC_1003;Massacre of [fatima_massacre_province.GetName];;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AEC_1003;Your pilgrimage to Fátima is one of the greatest experiences of your life so far. You made many new friends and learnt a lot about the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]. But today while you were going through [fatima_massacre_province.GetName], soldiers appeared in the distance. You thought they were on their regular patrol. When they got closer they started to charge your group without any clear reason! There are already corpses everywhere, some of your fellows are running, others are praying. Their leader, [fatima_massacre_commander.GetDynName] is smiling in pleasure and rests his eyes on you for a moment.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AEC_1005_A;The pilgrimage to Fátima ended in disaster. The pilgrims arrived in Iberia, but when they got to [fatima_massacre_province.GetName] [fatima_massacre_commander.GetDynName], the commander of [fatima_massacre_ruler.GetBestName] made a brutal massacre. Only [fatima_survivor.GetBestName] could escape and flee to court of [fatima_messenger_ruler.GetBestName]. [fatima_messenger_ruler.GetSheHeCap] immediately reported it to [fatima_messenger_ruler.religion_head.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick]. [fatima_massacre_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] claimed it was just a misunderstanding but nobody believed this. After a series of letters, the [fatima_messenger_ruler.religion_head.GetTitle] decided to change the crusade's target to the [fatima_massacre_kingdom.GetFullBaseName]. [fatima_religion.GetName] faithfuls are ready to take revenge on the [fatima_massacre_ruler.Religion.GetName]s!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_AEC_1006;Fall of [fatima_massacre_kingdom.GetName];;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AEC_1006;With their great numbers and bravery the [Root.Religion.GetName] Crusaders crushed the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] forces. [e_apostolic_empire.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] established the Apostolic Empire to keep the route to Fátima safe for the pilgrims. Only time will tell if the two religions' conflict concluded or this was just the first grand wars of many.;;;;;;;;;;x
