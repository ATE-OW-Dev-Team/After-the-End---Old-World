EVTNAMEYUGO1;Crisis of Authority;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO1;The Jugoslavist religion has always been an uncomfortable compromise, intended to secure religious peace in the Balkans at last. At no point have many people actually believed in this syncretic admixture of Christianity and Islam, but most people have been persuaded to go along with the charade. Recently, however, a zealous preacher has been drawing crowds of followers by preaching loudly that the Truth is more important than Peace,  and that we cannot simply blaspheme the Word of God,  even if doing so lessens the spilling of blood. [Root.GetTitledName] has condemned the man, but few heed him. All eyes wait for the Emperor to intervene, for it is his duty to support the Jugoslavist faith, and without him, it is unlikely to weather this storm.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.1;This will be long and painful.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.1;This is a Church matter, so the Church should deal with it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.1;The preacher is right - I've had enough of this charade too.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.1;Trouble is brewing?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.1;Trouble in the Balkans? Does this really count as news?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO2;The Battle Plan;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO2;Now that you have decided to support the Propiciater against the rebels, you should think about how precisely you intend to deal with this problem. The preacher and his associates are rapidly gaining followers, and we must act quickly if we are to stem this tide.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.2;Ban his movement and arrest his followers!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.2;Write and disseminate a theological treatise thoroughly refuting him;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.2;On second thoughts, this seems hard. Just give a token statement of support.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO3;Mild Discontent;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO3;Your efforts have borne fruit - the preacher's followers have started to dry up, and it seems that people are slowly coming around to your way of seeing things. While it will take many decades for peace to truly return, all you have to do now is wait out the rebels.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.3;This is about as good as we could've hoped for.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO4;A Fire of Discontent;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO4;Your attempts have been successful - in part. You have managed to stamp out the worst centres of the rebellion, but they retain widespread popular support, and your actions have alienated the commonfolk. It will be many years before this settles down, and who knows what his followers might be inspired to do in the meantime?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.4;We will endure this.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO5;A Firestorm of Discontent;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO5;Disaster! Your attempts to counteract the preacher have completely backfired, and now his teachings are spreading all over the Empire! You'll have to hold on for dear life if you want to survive...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.5;Why did we even start this stupid religion?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO6;The Truth, At Last;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO6;Finally, you have the opportunity to rid yourself of the ghastly joke that is Jugoslavism. But what religion do you truly follow, then?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.6;The Holy Orthodox Faith.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.6;The Holy Catholic Faith;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.6;I follow the words of the Prophet;;;;;;;;;x
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO8;Triumph of Jugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO8;Despite the challenges that it has faced, the Jugoslavist faith has stood resolute, never allowing the forces of sedition or rebellion to overwhelm it. By now, the energies of the rebels have been exhausted, and people have come to accept that the faith will not be gotten rid of. This represents a major shift, as the people of the Balkans are now more or less content to let the Jugoslavist church rule over them, at least in the public sphere. In addition, for the first time, groups of people who seem to sincerely believe in Jugoslavism have come forth, and have established religious communities and making themselves part of Balkan life. Perhaps in the future, Jugoslavism will no longer be treated as a joke?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.8;A Triumph Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.8;We'll finally have peace now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.8;Our poor Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.8;May Allah destroy them!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.8;Who?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO9;Survival of Jugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO9;Despite the challenges that it has faced, the Jugoslavist faith has stood resolute. Despite the chaos that has consumed the Balkans, it has maintained its hold over the core of the Empire, and people are now willing to, at the very least, go back to pretending to believe in it publically.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.9;A Triumph Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.9;We'll finally have peace now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.9;Our poor Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_yugoslav.9;Who?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO10;Death of Jugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO10;It is finally over. The sham church established by the Yugoslavian Emperor is finished. Nobody attends its ceremonies, instead flocking to Churches and Mosques. Nobody listens to [Root.GetTitledName]'s pronouncements, and even the Empire itself is no longer formally Jugoslavist. Today, [Root.GetTitledName], seeing the complete lack of relevance that Jugoslavism had to the Balkans, formally laid down his symbols of office, and resigned. Nobody appointed a successor.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.10;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.10;What a horrible tragedy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.10;Gloria In Excelsis Deo!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_yugoslav.10;Who?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO11;Crusader Kings;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO11;In recent years, the Jugoslavist religion has been greatly strengthened by the actions of wise and faithful rulers. The faith's power has grown so much that [Root.GetTitledName] has decided that they should direct their efforts outwards, for the world is still filled with heathen darkness, and the Jugoslavist faithful must bring the light to these benighted souls. This marks the beginning of a new era, when Jugoslavists will go on Crusade.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.11;Our Realm Will Expand!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.11;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_yugoslav.11;Foolish Christians!..they are Christians, right?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO12;The Fickle Finger Of Fate;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO12;You have decided to take no action against the troublesome preachers. Whatever happens now is entirely out of your hands.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.12;So be it;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO13;The Car Demands Your Obedience;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO13;With the triumph of the Jugoslavist religion, [From.GetTitledName] has ordered that all of his subjects should convert, and give up their old faiths. No leeway is given in this matter - anyone who refuses to convert will be considered the enemy of the Crown.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.13;I will accept Jugoslavism.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.13;I will say the words, but I will keep my true faith in secret.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.13;Never!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEYUGO15;Order of Saint Tito;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO15;With the consolidation of the Jugoslavist faith, monastic orders have been formed for the defense and propagation of the religion. One of these is a group of pious knights who have joined together for the defense of Jugoslavism against its many enemies. They refuse to fight other Jugoslavists, and work tirelessly to defend the faithful from their many enemies.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.15;At last we have our own protectors.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.15;They are still infidels!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCYUGO102;The reports of your commanders were clear. Even your most loyal warriors follow heathen practices in the camps. One makes confessions, another turn his carpet to Mecca and the third prays to an icon.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_yugoslav.102;I see no problem here.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO103;A [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] or some may say inquisitor preaches in [province_to_convert.GetName]. While there are less and less heathens there, there are many complains about his rather merciless methods.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_yugoslav.103;I must summon him to my court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.103;This is his job after all.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO104;[Root.RelHead.GetTitledName] sent me a detailed letter about the [Root.Religion.GetName] church's financial problems. [Root.RelHead.GetSheHeCap] promises that our [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s would use the money to strengthen the people's faith therefore my realm too.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.104;Provide tax privileges to them!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_yugoslav.104;The state isn't charity.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCYUGO105;You have heard many rumours about the lords of your realm practicing different secret religions. These aren't new. But today you caught two courtiers whispering that you go to heathen ceremonies too!;;;;;;;;;x
