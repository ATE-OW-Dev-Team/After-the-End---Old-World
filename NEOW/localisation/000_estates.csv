wuxia_training_desc;As a Wuxia practitioner, you can spend a period of time in training and contemplation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX3;Your month long training has come to an end, you can now return to your normal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX3;I shall return to my normal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX4;You have spent the last few days training with [new_sect_friend.GetFirstName] Their skills and yours seem to develop better when you challenge each other, and [new_sect_friend.GetHerHis] has asked you if you wish to train together more often.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX4;It would be my pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX5;You were training at the local monastery of your Sect, when suddenly a person entered from the gate. [new_sect_enemy.GetFirstName] claims that your sect is not the true path to Enlightenment, and challenges your Sect to prove otherwise by facing him in honorable duel.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX5;I will face them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX5;Let someone else face them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCWX5;Or we can all show you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX51;[new_sect_enemy.GetFirstName] lies defeated on the ground. Before falling unconscious and being escorted outside, he swears revenge on you. You might have made an enemy today…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX51;I will be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX52;You fall on your knees, defeated by your opponent’s mastery of martial arts. [new_sect_enemy.GetFirstName] roars in triumph, gloating at his success. As they walk away, your fellow Sect members help you up. They offer words of encouragement, but you can tell they are a bit disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX52;I’ll do better next time…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX6;The time spent Training has proven useful. You can feel your body invigorated, and the soreness in your muscles is gone. Under the guide of your Sect, you have stepped further toward Enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX6;A well-spent time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX7;Your muscles are sore, your back hurts, and training with the traditional weapons of your Sect has left your hands bloody without being any close to mastering them. Even with the help of your Sect, you don’t feel particularly close to Enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX7;What a disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX8;Your fellow Sect members have expressed their concerns over your diet. They believe you are spending too much time eating, and not enough time contemplating the meaning of your training. “It is not just power we seek, young man. You must abandon mortal desires if you hope to achieve the true goal of our faith.” A Master wisely warns you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX8;I feel ashamed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX8;I am not fat!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCWX8;I can prove my skills!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX9;Your refusal to eat has caught the eyes of several fellow Sect members. Together, they come to you and suggest you should try to eat more. “We admire your dedication to fasting, but it is unwise to weaken yourself by doing so. One must find a fine balance, lest they lose their way toward Enlightenment.” A Master warns you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX9;I understand, master.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX9;I will fast as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX10;As the dawn shines through the sky, your night of meditation comes to an end. The morning dew has settled on your brows and air, and you feel one with nature, fully connected with the world around you. As a bird settles on your shoulder, you breath, at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX10;What a great experience.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX11;The scorching heat of the sun burns on your shirtless body, but you hold steadfast on your goal. Spending the entire day exposed to the elements in this summer day will strengthen your body and mind. With that in mind, you try to hold your meditative state through the hottest part of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX11;I can’t do this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX11;I can do this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX12;The snow settles on your shoulders and head as you take deep breaths to calm your shivering. Shirtless, you feel the icy wind running on your skin, and the melting droplets of snow descend on your face and body, as it grows colder. You try to hold through the night as your skin grows cold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX12;I can’t do this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX12;I can do this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX13;You are training by yourself on a peaceful incline not far from the temple, when suddenly an old man sits nearby, watching you. As time passes, you can’t help but notice the intensity of his look. Unable to hold your curiosity, you speak. “Can I help you, sir?” You ask, without interrupting the flow of your training. The man smiles. “I’m a wandering traveller, nothing more.” He replies, “Merely pursuing Enlightenment in my own way.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX13;Ask more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX13;Let it go.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX131;After a little longer, the man notices your lack of interest. He stands up, bowing. “May your training prove successful, and your mind grow clearer.” He says, before disappearing down the slope. You wonder who he was. In his stride, however, you recognize the fierce stride of a trained warrior. Perhaps he was more than meets the eye…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX131;May you have a safe travel.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX132;“Your own way?” You ask, wary. It’s not rare for members of rival Sects to ambush each other, and in the way the man carries himself you recognize someone with a mastery of Martial Arts. “My own way. I seek to better myself, not through the Sects, but through my own strength. A lonely path, but a rewarding one.”Those words catch your attention. Is there another path, besides the Sects?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX132;“Tell me more.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX132;Let it go.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCWX132;“I don’t believe it.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX1321;He nods, and lets you sit in front of him. He shares his tales of training alone, in the mountains, tide down by nothing. A path of self-reflection and self-discovery, and a path of developing unique styles of martial arts, personal to him. He tells you the tale of the immortals that can reach the very pinnacle of their strength, the Xian, the masters of Qi Cultivation. As he talks, you grow…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX1321;Interested.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWX1321;Bored.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCWX1321;Angry at his words against the Sects, enough to stand up and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWX13211;He continues explaining, and you find yourself fascinated by the tales of great exploits and by the idea of immortality achieved through lonely training. As he continues, you ask. “Would you teach me the way to reach this goal?”He smiles. “It is not for me to teach, it is for you to learn by yourself. Set forth alone and find your path. The way of Xianxia is arduous, but rewarding.”With those words, he stands up, bows, and before you can say anything more sets on his way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWX13211;I will.;;;;;;;;;;;x

koyapunem_DESC;The native Gond religion, Koyapunem meaning "the way of nature", was founded by Pari Kupar Lingo. In Gond folk tradition, adherents worship a high god known as Baradeo, whose alternate names are Bhagavan, Kupar Lingo, Badadeo, and Persa Pen. Baradeo oversees activities of lesser gods such as clan and village deities as well as ancestors. Baradeo is respected but he does not receive fervent devotion, which is shown only to clan and village deities, ancestors, and totems. These village deities include Aki Pen, the village guardian and the anwal, the village mother goddess, a similar paradigm to folk traditions of other Dravidian peoples. Before any festival occurs, these two deities are worshipped. Each clan has their own persa pen, meaning "great god". This god is benign at heart but can display violent tendencies.;;;;;;;;;x

sarvodaya_DESC;Sarvodaya, meaning "universal uplift" is an Indian post-Event movement that arose after the fall of Indian democracy. Described by contemporary scholars as something between a religion and a philosophy, adherents of Sarvodaya consider themselves the true successors of the Indian state. While their beliefs are still largely Dharmic in nature, considering all Hindu gods valid manifestations of Brahman or Shakti, they are ultimately secular, not encouraging or discouraging any worship among their followers. Sarvodaya adherents worship a wide variety of gods, Hindu or otherwise, but a curiosity in their lands is the notable lack of state-funded temples, with the religion having no formal religious hierarchy and any religious temples being privately upkept. Philosophically, Sarvodaya largely draws inspiration from the teachings of the legendary Mahatma, with an extremely strict adherence to ahimsa and vegetarianism. Additional key sages in Sarvodaya are Vinoba Bhave, Nehru, and Shrimad Rajchandra, among others. Politically, Sarvodaya fiercely advocates for "swaraj" - the concept of self-rule. While some consider this to mean self-rule of countries against foreign powers, the most often interpreted meaning is the self-rule of the populace against the political state both morally and economically. As a result, Sarvodaya realms are often republican and elective in nature, and tyranny is rarely tolerated. Additionally, Sarvodaya adherents are frequent practitioners of satyagraha, the practice of nonviolent resistance. Sarvodaya satyagrahis frequently attempt to achieve positive social changes throughout India to varying levels of success.;;;;;;;;;;;x
