koyapunem_DESC;The native Gond religion, Koyapunem meaning "the way of nature", was founded by Pari Kupar Lingo. In Gond folk tradition, adherents worship a high god known as Baradeo, whose alternate names are Bhagavan, Kupar Lingo, Badadeo, and Persa Pen. Baradeo oversees activities of lesser gods such as clan and village deities as well as ancestors. Baradeo is respected but he does not receive fervent devotion, which is shown only to clan and village deities, ancestors, and totems. These village deities include Aki Pen, the village guardian and the anwal, the village mother goddess, a similar paradigm to folk traditions of other Dravidian peoples. Before any festival occurs, these two deities are worshipped. Each clan has their own persa pen, meaning "great god". This god is benign at heart but can display violent tendencies.;;;;;;;;;x

sarvodaya_DESC;Sarvodaya, meaning "universal uplift" is an Indian post-Event movement that arose after the fall of Indian democracy. Described by contemporary scholars as something between a religion and a philosophy, adherents of Sarvodaya consider themselves the true successors of the Indian state. While their beliefs are still largely Dharmic in nature, considering all Hindu gods valid manifestations of Brahman or Shakti, they are ultimately secular, not encouraging or discouraging any worship among their followers. Sarvodaya adherents worship a wide variety of gods, Hindu or otherwise, but a curiosity in their lands is the notable lack of state-funded temples, with the religion having no formal religious hierarchy and any religious temples being privately upkept. Philosophically, Sarvodaya largely draws inspiration from the teachings of the legendary Mahatma, with an extremely strict adherence to ahimsa and vegetarianism. Additional key sages in Sarvodaya are Vinoba Bhave, Nehru, and Shrimad Rajchandra, among others. Politically, Sarvodaya fiercely advocates for "swaraj" - the concept of self-rule. While some consider this to mean self-rule of countries against foreign powers, the most often interpreted meaning is the self-rule of the populace against the political state both morally and economically. As a result, Sarvodaya realms are often republican and elective in nature, and tyranny is rarely tolerated. Additionally, Sarvodaya adherents are frequent practitioners of satyagraha, the practice of nonviolent resistance. Sarvodaya satyagrahis frequently attempt to achieve positive social changes throughout India to varying levels of success.;;;;;;;;;;;x
