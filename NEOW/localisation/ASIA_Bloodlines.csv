bludlines1Desc;In the aftermath of the War in Heaven, the followers of the Ruby Chairman's righteous cause liberated China from the humiliating exploitation of the Eight Armies, and banished the forces of the Sapphire Didact.

bludlines3Title;The Ascendant Dragon;;;;;;;;;x
bludlines3Desc;Generations ago, China was bespoiled by foreign invaders and then torn asunder in a great civil war caused by the betrayal of the Jade Emperor by his generals, the Ruby Chairman and the Sapphire Didact. This departure from the Dao, the natural order of the universe, led to a century of violence, suffering, and famine- even before the calamity of the Event. Now, under the guidance of Heavenly [e.taoist.Holder.getFirstNameWithNick], China is once again following the divine path. Claiming to be a reformation of the ancient Song dynasty, many see their great successes as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven has been secured, surely as a result of the house of [e_taoist.Holder.getOnlyDynastyName]'s dilligence in following the Dao. The Sapphire Didact and Ruby Chairman's disruption of the balance of the cosmos is being corrected, and soon all of China shall be restored again under one harmonious banner. ;;;;;;;;;x

bludlines4Title;The Heavenly Resurgence;;;;;;;;;x
bludlines4Desc;Christianity in China has frequently been a target of persecution, fluctuating between tolerance and outright oppression, with some simply seeing it as a religion of outsiders, and others going as far as claiming it was a tool of the Eight Armies which had humiliated China during the War in Heaven.

By the will of God, made manifest through the rulership of [e_heavenly.Holder.getOnlyDynastyName], long-held beliefs in the possibilty of a Heavenly Kingdom being established on Earth by Divine Mandate have now been made reality.
