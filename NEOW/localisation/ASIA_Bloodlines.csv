bludlines3Title;The Ascendant Dragon;;;;;;;;;x
bludlines3Desc;Generations ago, China was bespoiled by foreign invaders and then torn asunder in a great civil war caused by the betrayal of the Jade Emperor by his generals, the Ruby Chairman and the Sapphire Didact. This departure from the Dao, the natural order of the universe, led to a century of violence, suffering, and famine- even before the calamity of the Event. Now, under the guidance of Heavenly [e.taoist.Holder.getFirstNameWithNick], China is once again following the divine path. Claiming to be a reformation of the ancient Song dynasty, many see their great successes as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven has been secured, surely as a result of the house of [e_taoist.Holder.getOnlyDynastyName]'s dilligence in following the Dao.
