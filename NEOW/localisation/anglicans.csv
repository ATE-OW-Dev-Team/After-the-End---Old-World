EVTDESC_george_102;Dear [Root.GetTitledName],\nIt has been made known to me that you wish to join our order. After contemplating on the matter I, [From.GetTitledName], have decided permit this. May you be used well in humbly serving the Lord.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_102;I am honored.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_122;Dear [Root.GetTitledName],\nYou have served the order well. I hereby appoint you a new station more befitting of your abilities.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_122;I am honored.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_141;Members of the order should always maintain their fighting ability. There is a drill upcoming that I would like you to take a part in.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_145;While drilling with the Order I met a fellow by the name of [FROM.GetFirstName]. After talking between drills we seem to get along well.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_145;We should make good friends.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_george_145;Now let us focus on the drill.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_146;Partaking in this drill has certainly had an effect. Eyes always seem to be on me to look for guidance and I can feel myself improving. It might even be worth doing these drills in my own time.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_146;It's all worth it for the Lord.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_150;Same with this one.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_162;Answering your request, a knightly commander by the name of [FROM.GetFirstNameWithNick] has arrived.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_162;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_170;A proclamation has gone out across the lands, carried by messengers of the Order of Saint George, to tell the God-fearing Christian folk that [ROOT.GetTitledName] partakes in a righteous war, and that it is imperative to aid his struggle as the whole of Christendom is under threat should he fail.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_170;Who wouldn't be convinced by that.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_172;Today our army was approached by force marching under the banner of no earthly Lord, but a banner of the Lord in heaven. They declared their loyalty to our just cause and their will to fight under us until such a time as the conflict is ended.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_172;And not a moment too soon.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_george_173;Messengers from the Order of Saint George have reported that it is becoming harder to convince the faithful that our war is just in the eyes of God. How are we to continue?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_173;I know exactly how to find willing recruits.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_george_174;As our war has continued there has been talk among some of those who joined our ranks that our struggle is perhaps no longer the just cause that it was. Some of their leaders have come forward and asked why they should continue leading their men in this conflict and not return to their wives and children to provide for.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_george_174;Passionately explain the wider importance of our war.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ANGLICAN_HOLY_24;When [Root.Religion.GetName] warriors entered London, their biggest surprise was the perfect condition of Saint Paul's. In the shadows of London, a group of [Root.Religion.GetName] zealous were risking their lives to defend the cathedral. They killed Thelmatic looters and through rigorous drill prevented any damage to the building. Now they have revealed themselves and since they no longer need to work in secret their leader decided to reorganize the group. They chose the name of a legendary order, defending the faith before the event, the Army of Salvation. They are grabbing weapons and ready to go on the fields against the infidel!;;;;;;;;;x

quaker_DESC;Before the event the Quakers, also known as the Friends, were most well known for their position as conscientious objectors to war and a mostly silent and leaderless style of worship practiced by a portion, along with a theology focused on a direct and internal relationship with God. While this position has made rulership seem unobtainable in the post event world, a surprising number of Quakers have found a penchant among those working for the merchant class.;;;;;;;;;x
