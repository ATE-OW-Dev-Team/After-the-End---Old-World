history_266611108_desc;§YThree years ago, at the order of Lord Protector Frydyryk II, a large expedition of nearly eight thousand men led by James Crhowhill was launched from London with two objectives: To land in Gibraltar and dissuade any thoughts Andalusia and Al-Maghrib might have about claiming the port, and to re-establish control of Egypt. The reason for Egypt is threefold- It is a holy land to the Thelemic faiths, the Suez Canal is one of the most valuable waterways in the world, and Egypt was once a part of historical Britannia (Once long before the Event, and again in the early 2300s). After landing in Port Said, the goals of the Second Expedition in Egypt are in reach. But now Brytannya deals with the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion, and the Second Expediton cannot rely on support from the Crown. While the port is a strong foothold, James Crhowhill and his forces find themselves far from home and surrounded by enemies. But their faith is true, and their resolve is iron.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664235_desc;§YFour centuries ago, Egypt was one of the first nations to reunite after the Event (though as a kingdom rather than a republic). Its first century was a relatively stable period until the Coptic population revolted after particularly cruel oppression and took control of the kingdom. The next century saw peace, until the throne was inherited by a child and the resulting succession crisis broke into civil war. This war was ended by the arrival of a large fleet off the coast of Alexandria- Lord Protector Obyron Strhongboarh had sent an army to reclaim Egypt for the British Throne. Disunited, Egypt was swiftly conquered and a Governate was established until Britannia could no longer support the expedition, and it was overthrown. Egypt remained divided for two hundred and thirteen years until Essam Abaza re-established the kingdom under his just and compassionate hand. But now he faces two enemies at his door- the nomads of the Saharan Confederacy seek to spread their new faith, and the British are once again attempting to shackle Egypt to their Empire. Egypt remains unified, but Essam must act or see his hard-won victory fade into the sand like so many before him.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26670023_desc;§YWhen the world ended, American warriors of Al-Sunta'Kum- a borderline mythical army with the ability to win a war in a hundred hours and destroy a kingdom in 40 days gathered in the Persian Gulf- rallying in Qatar and Bahrain. While a melding together of Qatari, Bahraini, and American customs and traditions after five hundred years of working and living together, the military strength and the prevalence of the old war machines of Al-Sunta'Kum have led to their descendants being known collectively as the Amriqi.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26674333_desc;§YThe Kuhjung of Kaiserslautern are the descendants of a legendary army that were said to have ruled the skies of all Europe and Africa, moving with such speed that entire legions could be moved across the world in a single day, and whole cities could be wiped off the face of the Earth in an instant. These soldiers were all over Europe and over the first century returned to Kaiserslautern and Ramstein according to contingency plans made long ago. With their boisterous attitudes and talent for combat, they became known as the Kuhjung (lit. "Cowboy")- named after legendary roaming Amerikaner warriors of their homeland.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_22660079_desc;§YWhile never officially a part of Nistrenia, the marriage of Konstantin II and Florina Kirtoka in 2349 did briefly unite the two crowns after she reclaimed her throne in 2357- before ending in tragedy with Imparateasa Florina dying in childbirth in 2361.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26667146_desc;§YWhen she was 9 years old, Florina Kirtoka fled Nistrenia with her mother after her father, Mihail, and her uncle, Imparat Corneliu I, were murdered by their half brother Aron in a plot for the throne. Fleeing to Hungary, she would marry Balogh Konstantin II while in exile and ruling alongside him when he inherited the throne of Hungary. In 2355, she would go to war against Lucian Fifor (who had defeated Aron and taken the throne of Nistrenia in 2349). Two years later, Lucian was defeated and Florina Kirtoka was crowned Imparateasa. But this victory was short-lived. In 2361, Imparateasa Florina died giving birth to a stillborn child. With no successor or heir, the Kirtoka line died out and the Empire broke out into civil war once again.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_77667152_desc;§YStanislau Kirtoka-Egrisi is the fourth-great grandson of Stanislau Mihailescu- a bastard son of Mihail Kirtoka. Stanislau (the Elder) and his mother fled Nistrenia when he was 6 years old in 2316 after his father was murdered by his own half-brother in a scheme for the throne of Nistrenia. They fled to Georgia, were given a minor estate there. Eventually, he had established himself and his family in Georgian politics by fighting for his liege, and the family adopted the Kirtoka name in their exile- forming house Kirtoka-Egrisi. Now Stanislau (the Younger) serves loyally in Georgia, the sole remaining member of the legendary Kirtoka bloodline.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_266730000_desc;§YIn 2070 a massive earthquake happened in the North Sea, flooding parts of Europe for years, destroying many of the surviving buildings and having aftershocks felt as far as Italy. While it is many years before it is noticed, the earthquake also pushed part of the ancient Dogger Bank above sea level- Over the next two centuries these raised sections become the islands forming what is now known as Doggerland. Settlers arrived through the 2100s-2200s, English people fleeing the Thelemic Wars encountered Danish and Norwegian refugees who had fled the Witcher-King invasion. These three peoples would unite in the face of the harsh conditions of the North Sea and are now known as the Doggersker. Now, Edgar Wrihtssen is the first man to unite the Doggersker under one throne. In 2550, After a year-long war Lord Edgar the Conqueror now controls the Admiralty of Doggerland and unleashes his fleets upon the worlds seas to establish a pirate kingdom like the world has never seen before.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664200_desc;§YIn the first half of the 25th century, during the Ovchinnikov-Avvakum wars in Perm and Uralia, large clans of the Nenet people left their arctic homeland. Heading southeast across the steppe beyond the Ural Mountains, they have now made their home on the shores of what is left of the Aral Sea. Now the Sévtonenécs ("The people who saw the lake" lit. "eye-lake-people") are once again seeking for safer pastures away from the hordes surrounding them. Paréngoda Mandak has turned his eyes south to Khorasan, and hope to find a new homeland where his people may put down roots.§!;;;;;;;;x

history_26662003_desc;§YSebastian "the Strange" Angstrom was an oddity in Scandinavian history. Unlike the Kingdoms of Norway and Denmark founded a century earlier with their stable history, noble lineages and historical claims, Sebastian was a lowly (and possibly insane) peasant who rebelled against his village lord and swiftly rallied the surrounding peasants and unified the common folk of southern Sweden to become the first King of Sweden. He then attempted an invasion of Denmark, was slain in battle and his body was lost at sea. The 17-month old kingdom immediately fell apart and Sweden remained a collection of independent duchies and tribes for two centuries.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664106_desc;§YCarl Bernadotte-Väestergötland is the bastard son of the late Johan Bernadotte-Väestergötland. Claiming to be a descendant of the antediluvian royal house Bernadotte of Sweden, Johan had united southern Sweden for the first time in two centuries since the death of Sebastian "The Strange" in 2311. Johan is known as the Lawgiver for putting an end to the squabbling and fighting of the last two centuries. Carl is known for his religious zeal and his skills as a commander and tactician, but recently has fallen into a depressive mood after his half-sister and eloped with a man from Picardy, leaving him alone with few friends and without any family.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664127_desc;§YOn February 16th, 2356- Grand Duke Mindaugus V Alelkaitis was slain in battle by Paulius Juze in the Eastern Crusade- bringing the 260 years of Neo-Romuvan control over Lithuania and Belarus to a close. Paulius Juze was made the new Grand Duke, and the Eastern Crusade came to and end. The Orthodox-practicing Belarusians around Minsk had joined the Catholic crusaders against the Lithuanian pagans, and sought independence entirely from Lithuania- but with no allies available to ensure their sovereignty (Nistrenia, the only Orthodox realm in the region, was embroiled in a civil war at the time) they swore fealty to the Catholics. The Holy League remained in Lithuania on Pope Amelius Is orders, officially to "ensure the Romuva scourge was completely removed" but also to enforce the new Grand Duchys stability and control. Eleven years later, Pope Kilian III, Pope Ameliuss successor, recalled the Holy League from Lithuania and left the remaining conversion and purges to local officials. This semi-autonomy led to the Belarusians around Minsk converting Romuvans to Orthodoxy as opposed to Catholicism, and leads to friction into the present day.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_30000441_desc;§YHiiliye Mejahad led his crew on many raids along the shores of the Arabian Sea, even going so far as the coast of Mumbai during the upheaval of Arin Arindi's conquest of Rajputana. While on this adventure, he and his fleet attacked a Sri Lankan convoy, taking several monks captive. While sailing back to Puntland, Hiiliye grew curious about the faith of these monks. One of them, Hujata, began answering his question and taught Hiiliye of Buddhism. This curiosity grew into conversion, and friendship between the two. Hiiliye converts to Therevada Buddhism and takes the name Avirada. He then gives Hujata and the other monks their freedom, and they set out with his blessing as missionaries to preach the teachings of the Buddha throughout Puntland, converting many others.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664027_desc;§YFor a brief moment, the House of Olteanu held the throne of Nistrenia- Rege Ovidiu Olteanu of Romania, claimed the right to the throne in 2480 AD, after the death of the last Portocalie Împarat, Octavian III. Ovidiu claimed that because his late brother, Alexandru Olteanu, had been named by Ciprian II Portocalie as his secondary legatee after Florin Portocalie, Ciprian's son. And with House Portocalie ending in the death of Florin his son Octavian III, thus Ovidiu Olteanu would be next in line. After a short war with Octavian's widow, Adela Gincu, Ovidiu ascended to the throne of the most powerful empire in Europe before being murdered by a clerk, Corneliu Belasco. Ovidiu's brother, Alexandru, remained in Romania, inheriting the throne. Now the great-grandson of Alexandru, Stefan Olteanu, has broken away from Transnistria and proclaimed himself the emperor Southern Transnistria- claiming that after the last seventy five years of decay, only House Olteanu are fit to rule Nistrenia.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26661504_desc;§YVittorio Segni first made his mark on history by spearheading the Catholic reconquest of Provence in 2530 after it had diplomatically broken away from the Noveliste duchy of Occitan. Giving the duchy to his Corsican general- Giuseppe Garibaldi, was not just a show of gratitude for his general's service and tactical skill, but a diplomatic move seen as quite graceful in the eyes of the Catholics in the Mediterranean. Being the man responsible for the first Catholic conquest West of the Rhineland and Italy since the Event, many grew to view Vittorio with great respect. Between the war for Provence, being crowned Re of Sardinia and Corsica in 2539, and the conquest of the independent city-state of Tunis a year later in 2540- his reputation as a respectable king led to the Duke of Sicily willingly offering his vassalage and protection. Most recently, the island of Cephalonia has also been brought under Sardinia's rule. Re Vittorio is not just a bulwark protecting the heart of Roman Catholicism, but with a foothold in three separate shores he is uniquely positioned to set his armies on any who would seek to wrest control of the Mediterranean.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_16674380_desc;§YThe Ovchinnikovs had been the historical rulers of Perm and Uralia since Rem I established the kingdoms in the 2300s. This changed after the Old Beliver revolt of 2400, when the Christian population of Perm rallied behind Aleks Avvakum against the pagan rule of the Ovchinnikovs, which concluded with Aleks Avvakum killing Vukol Ovchinnikov in battle and impaling his body on a pike. Kalina Ovchinnikov, Vukol's sister, assumed control of Uralia and swore revenge against Aleks. The next forty one years were filled with war for control of Perm- a back-and-forth conflict between the two rulers. Eventually, Kalina killed Aleks, but was then slain herself by his son Hfarlam. Her son Rem II remained in control of Uralia, but over the next century the kingdom declined in power and territory, until the death of Rem III by the hand of a bandit chief. While the Ovchinnikovs are no more, their blood lives on through the bastard grandsons of Kalina ruling among the cold taiga of the Ural mountains§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26674291_desc;§YAleks Avvakum was a giant of a man, and the leader of the Old Believer revolt for Perm in 2400. Successfully wresting dominion from the pagan hands of the Ovchinnikovs, he fought with Kalina Ovchinnikov for over forty one years before meeting his death at her hands. Aleks was avenged by his son, Hfarlam, who succeded in fully ousting the Ovchinnikovs from Perm. For the last century Perm has been a stronghold of the Old Believer faithful, and its position along the Trans-Siberian Trade route makes it a unique gateway between the East and West of what was formerly Russia.§!;;;;;;;;x

Prince Arthur Runesson is known to his friends for his honeyed words, and to his enemies for his zeal in brutal combat, bearing down on all his foes.

history_26669000_desc;§YIn 2532 The Ecumenical Patriarch Carol III Dragos conspired with Korol Hryhoriy Kobzar of Ukraine to stabilize Nistrenia after decades of decline and corruption. A combined army of Ukrainian and the Patriarchate's forces moved into the Sorocan Palace, and imprisoned and executed Emperor Mihail Orban for murdering the previous Emperor. Ieremia Dragos, the Patriarch's son, is chosen as the new Împarat due to his impressive skills as an administrator. His next twenty two years were dedicated to stabilizing what little was left of an empire that once stretched from Carpathia to the Caspian. Through massive purges he was able to quench the scheming and entrenched imperial bureaucracy, and a new, electoral form of Imperial succession was established, where strong vassals would vote for the heir to the Imperiu to avoid another succession crisis like the one which had gone on for nearly half a century. Ciprian III is now responsible for the long road to restoring Nistrenia, looking through the long history of the empire for examples to guide him.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664016_desc;§YEmerikos III is the latest member of the Olympios dynasty, the founders of the once-mighty Makedonía. At its peak, it stretched from nearly the entire Balkan Peninsula to large swaths of Anatolia, and the islands of the Aegean sea either directly controlled or as tributary states, alongside the Isle of Cyprus. Over the three hundred years of conquest and subjugation, Orthodox Christianity had almost entirely been pushed out by the Ellinikós faith, And Greek culture and language came with it, the people of North Macedonia eventually lost or abandoned most of their Slavic language and became Hellenized, alongside the Turks in Thrace and along the Aegean coastline- now known as Rûmi. Recently, this rule was disrupted by a Pan-Slavic revolt led by Ivan I Crnodjordjevic against Emerikos II 'the Mad'. It was a devastating loss that shattered the empire, with Makedonía only clinging on along the Aegean coastline, and the remaining duchies were made tributaries by the newly reformed Jugoslavija.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26664006_desc;§YThe Crenodjordjevics made a name for themselves in 2391 with Ivan 'the Usurper' taking the throne of Serbia and freeing the upper Balkans from the suzerainty of Makedonía, then his son Alexsandar I defeating the armies of Nistrenia and slaying Octavian II (who was attempting to halt any potential threat), and most recently in the 2530's Edmund I 'the Holy' unified the Balkan people in destroying the power of Makedonía, resurrecting Jugoslavija, and codifying the diverse faiths of the people of this new empire into a new religion: Jugoslavism. The empire is now strong enough to rival the decaying Nistrenia, but with Edmund I's death twelve years ago his son Edmund II now sits on what may be the most unstable throne in all of Europe.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26661100_desc;§YHouse Cyflymarian entered into the stage of Brytysh history when Mwyn Cyflymarian of Essex turned against his liege Fragan Knights to assist Wynnyfryd Strhongboarh during the civil war known as "The Turbulent Years" at the end of the 2200's. Remaining loyal to the Strhongboarhs throughout the conquest of Scotland and marrying into the family, the in 2364 the Cyflymarians inherited the throne alongside eighty years of momentum that House Strhongboarh had built- and established Brytannya into a true Empire once more. The last two centuries saw the subjugation of Ireland, the invasion of Normandy, leaps in technological development, and even a new expedition to reclaim the former imperial territory of Egypt. It seemed like true domination over Europe would be certain- until 2553, with the successful rebellion of Ireland. Now, for the first time in centuries, Brytannya has been made to pause, and with Lord Protector Frydryk II's defeat whispers of rebellion have begun to creep through the rest of the Isles. Frydryk must act swiftly and decisively to prove the Cyflymarians still hold the favor of Victoria, or else risk civil war once again.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_4000000_desc;§YDragon Emperor Jigme XIX of the Druk Yul Chen Mo, the Thunder Dragon Empire of Bhutan, is reflective of his Empire. Old, content, and stagnant. Spending most of his twilight years tending his garden or reflecting on the Tantras. Indeed, the Dragons of Bhutan have spent the last five centuries resting in their mountain home- content in their palaces and cities that feel almost entirely untouched by the collapse of civilization compared to the rest of the word, as if it was a luxurious dream. A dream that might finally be over after the horrific murder of Jigme's son, Khamsum three months ago. Slain on his sixteenth birthday by his envious older brother Jigme XX, the halls of the Thunder Dragon Empire are clattering in confusion. Jigme XIX is old and infirm, and soon the throne will be in the hands of a murderous and ambitious tyrant. Jigme has one more child, Kesang, the twin sister of Khamsum. Many think she would be a much more desirable heir if the laws allowed it, or if Jigme XX met a similar fate to his brother. The bureaucratic workings of Bhutan are bloated, rusted and stagnant, but for the first time in half a millennia there is change on the horizon.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_27780001_desc;§YVladivostok endured the Event well in comparison to its neighbors. Vladivostok's lower population and less density allowed it to avoid the truly cataclysmic collapse of Korea, China, and Japan. This, in combination to its position as a bridge for trade between the Americas and Asia brought untold levels of power and wealth. Vladivostok maintains this hegemony not through directly owning swaths of territory, but through using trade and wealth to crush their foes. From time to time geopolitical rivals will emerge, attempting to unify China or otherwise rival Vladivostok- but the Republic quickly and aggressively cuts down these attempts before they can become a true threat. The most recent instance was the Kingdom of Jilin in 2554, when Grand Prince Genadi Makusimow slew the ambitious Chen Zhaohui in a personal battlefield duel, shattering the newly formed realm.§!;;;;;;;;x
history_26650554_desc;§YThe long-standing animosity between the Canarians and the Spaniards began in 2414, when contact with the islands were re-established and the discovery of Spanish Catholics outside of the Iberian Peninsula was met with great joy. But when the Canarians accepted the invitation to meet with the Sevillian Papacy in 2416, the delegation revealed they were loyal Roman Catholics. Addressing Pope Eleutherius III as "The Antipope of Seville" and calling on him to put an end to the Schism, the boldness of the Canarian delegation infuriated the Sevillian Pope, who had them ejected from the city that same day. This meeting shattered the hopes of the Sevillians that there was a presence of their faith on the islands, and began tensions between the two groups. Diplomatic friction further intensified with two invasion attempts (A Spanish invasion in 2425 and a Canarian attempt in 2494. Both ended in failure, first due to a sudden storm sinking the Spanish fleet, and the corsairs of Huelva intervening to save Andalucía from the second).§!;;;;;;;;x
history_45000053_desc;§YGrand Mayor Liam Gummow is the latest ruler of the trade hub that is Juneau. Truly a unique man in a peculiar position- he himself is unique among his peers as a convert to Amaitism after discovering the faith in his adventures and raids along the West Coast of America, and bringing the faith to his home city. Juneau and the Alaskans are unique in that they have a trade relationship with Vladivostok- The Alaskans (while hardy warriors and raiders) do not have the power to exert control beyond the Aleutians, but they do have the capability to disrupt trade between the continents. Thus, Vladivostok and Juneau came to an agreement. Juneau keeps the trade moving and sends mercenaries to Vladivostok, and Vladivostok allows them autonomy and support when people attempt to retaliate against Alaskan raids into Vancouver and beyond. It is not an amicable peace, but it is a profitable one.§!;;;;;;;;x

Panas Stovbur surrendered to Adriana in exchange for maintaining rule of Ukraine. While Ukrainians have been influential throughout the Nistrenian Empire's history, the administration has always prevented them from potentially being on the throne, and even their language and culture has been subjected to Latinization since Octavian Gandzbitte's standardized Imperial Transnistrian Grammar and dictionary reforms in 2401. This resentment has always gently bubbled below the surface- and  with the Empire now in a tailspin, Korol' Taras finds himself in a position to do something about it.§!;;;;;;;;x

But after thirteen years of hard work developing the Isle of Santa Maria from an agricultural tributary for pirate despots into a functioning urban center, Captain Abilio of the Paulistino Expedition unexpectedly died at age 45. His son Gabriel inherited the role of Captain at age 12.
