EVTDESC_european_union_restoration;The peoples of the European continent are numerous, and varied in language, religion and history. However, this great melting pot of peoples were once united under the European Union. Above culture, religion and national affilliation, the Union was a mighty state ruled by a President elected by a council of nobles from each corner of the realm. The Union brought the promise of prosperity to all that it ruled, and defended europe from threats both within and without. This was not to last, however, and the great Union of Europe collapsed of uncertain causes, and many believe that it fell due to the onslaught of the event itself. Nevertheless, the memory of the great state endured, and now, you have amassed enough power to declare yourself the President of All Europe, upholder of peace, bringer of prosperity, and the rightful sovereign of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
