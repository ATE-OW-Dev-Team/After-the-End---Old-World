EVTDESC_european_union_restoration;The peoples of the European continent are numerous, and varied in language, religion and history. However, this great melting pot of peoples were once united under the European Union. Above culture, religion and national affilliation, the Union was a mighty state ruled by a President elected by a council of nobles from each corner of the realm. The Union brought the promise of prosperity to all that it ruled, and defended europe from threats both within and without. This was not to last, however, and the great Union of Europe collapsed of uncertain causes, and many believe that it fell due to the onslaught of the event itself. Nevertheless, the memory of the great state endured, and now, you have amassed enough power to declare yourself the President of All Europe, upholder of peace, bringer of prosperity, and the rightful sovereign of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

TITLE_european_invasion;The Union Strikes Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC_european_invasion;In the age before the event, the Union is said to have ruled over the entirety of Europe, and all its varied peoples. It is uncertain as to what exactly caused its collapse. Was it an invasion? a terrible plague? a disastrous famine? a devastating civil war? Perhaps it was the event itself, whatever that may be? Nobody knows, but what is known for sure is that, at the union's most vulnerable moment, and at its time of greatest need, the vassal kingdom of Britain betrayed the Union, and abandoned it to its fate. The people of Europe would never forgive the acts of Perfidious Albion. The president of the restored Union could not let this humiliation go unavenged, and hence, the great leader of the europeans has decreed that the time has come to make war upon the British, and to lay waste their island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
