confederation_government_desc;Less of a state than a closely-bound network of autonomous allies sworn to defend each other in times of crisis, Confederations are held by an elected ruler who exercises a position of nominal sovereignty over the others. However, this power is largely ceremonial, and only within his demesne can the monarch exercise his typical sovereign policies. Confederation leaders cannot interfere in the religious policies of their subjects. Confederations benefit from being able to administer almost any type of realm through decentralisation, as well as being able to call upon all of their vassals in times of crisis.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# Formation of the German Confederation
confed3Title;A Crown From The Gutter;;;;;;;;;x
confed3Desc;The German peoples have always defended their independence fiercely, both politically and religiously. However, our fragmentation and disunity has also allowed despots and tyrants to make inroads into the heart of Deutschland, enforcing their strange ways upon us. It is clear that this situation is only going to get worse if nothing is done. An idea has begun to grow up throughout Germany in the last few decades, formed and shaped by legends of the Great Reichs of the past, a possible solution to our dissolution. A great union, a confederation of equals united in the defense of Germany, has been proposed, and after much deliberation, the intellectual leaders of the pan-German movement have decided that you would be the most fitting ruler to found this great union. Standing before you in your very throne room, these wise and learned nobles declare their unwavering support for your claim to this grand new endeavour. These men have connections across Germany, and while it is uncertain if anyone would join you, their influence should ensure that the lords of the land will at least give you a hearing.;;;;;;;;;x
confed3A;I will accept this burden;;;;;;;;;x
confed3B;I don't feel up to this - they should ask someone else;;;;;;;;;x

confed4Title;Join the Federation?;;;;;;;;;x
confed4Desc;The German peoples have always defended their independence fiercely, both politically and religiously. However, our fragmentation and disunity has also allowed despots and tyrants to make inroads into the heart of Deutschland, enforcing their strange ways upon us. For decades now, the idea of a pan-German union of equals to defend Germany has grown in popularity, and now it has come to fruition. A group of prominent intellectuals and nobles have proclaimed [From.GetTitledName] the ruler of the newborn German Confederation. These men have connections all over Germany, including in your own court. Many of your advisors are encouraging you to join the Confederation, assuring you that it serves only to defend Germans everywhere, that you would be able to retain your autonomy and armies, as well as being just as eligible for election to the role of Kaiser as any other ruler.;;;;;;;;;x
confed4A;From the Memel to the Meuse, Germans must stand brotherly together!;;;;;;;;;x
confed4B;I will never bow!;;;;;;;;;x

confed5Title;Rise of the German Confederation;;;;;;;;;x
confed5Desc;For centuries, Germany has been splintered, divided between petty kings, tribal warlords, and scattered city-states. This state of disunity has allowed Germans to be subjected to tyranny, and at last, something has been done about it. Many of the German princes have united together to form a Great Confederation, a loose alliance owing nominal loyalty to [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The new union should allow all Germans to unite their forces for the defence of their homeland, but it remains to be seen if this idealistic dream will endure, or if it will evaporate like the dew on the banks of the Rhine.;;;;;;;;;x
confed5A;At last, the German's fatherland;;;;;;;;;x
confed5B;The Germans uniting? Merciful God, not again...;;;;;;;;;x
confed5C;This reminds me of an ancient legend...and not a pleasant one;;;;;;;;;x
confed5D;Apparently we weren't German enough to be invited;;;;;;;;;x
confed5E;What a preposterous idea;;;;;;;;;x

confed6Desc;I have seen the wisdom of the pan-German cause and wish to join the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;x
confed7Desc;I will never join this tyrannical sham!;;;;;;;;;x
