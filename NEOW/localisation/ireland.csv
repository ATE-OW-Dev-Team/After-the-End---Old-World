EVTTITLE_irelandevents_1;A Troublesome Execution;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_irelandevents_1;The Irish have never fully accepted our dominion over their miserable country,and executions of those foolish enough to oppose the Will of the Queen have proven regrettably common. Today,however,we have come across an unusual problem. A prominent nationalist leader and Catholic has been captured and sentenced to execution in Dublin Square,but his popularity has proven to be far greater than we had thought. Thousands have turned out to show their anger at the execution,and the local Constables fear that it may break out into a full-blown riot if the execution goes ahead. As Governwyr,it is within your power to pardon the prisoner,and local leaders are encouraging you to do so in order to prevent an escalation of the violence. On the other hand,this man is a rebel and traitor - surely he deserves death if anyone does?;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_irelandevents_2;The Martyr of Dublin Square;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_irelandevents_2;Unfortunate news has arrived from the countryside. Apparently,the execution of such a famous and beloved leader has hardened the attitudes of the Irish even further against our rule,erasing the small amount of goodwill that we had earned. All across the country,the image of the executed leader is handed out and carried,surrounded with a halo like that of a Saint. In death,his influence seems to have spread even further than it did in life. This is likely to entrench Irish attitudes towards us,making our task of assimilation ever harder in the decades to come. Unless,of course,we could find a way to suppress this new devotion…;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_irelandevents_3;Rebellion in Ireland! The British's attempts to crack down on the supporters of a recently-executed nationalist hero have further inflamed tensions,setting the Irish to outright revolt! From the chaos,a skilled and fiery orator has risen to lead them,marshalling the militant mob into a cohesive army. Now they have declared open rebellion,aiming to entirely free Ireland from our control!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_LOM_creation;The Legion of Mary Rises;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LOM_creation;The Irish people have a long history of pious devotion to the Church, and among them the desire has grown for a new militant order to protect Mother Church and Christendom as a whole. Taking their name from an antediluvian religious group, The Legion of Mary has assembled and risen to the task. A fraternal order of knights and ordinary civilians, the Legion is centered in Ireland and draws most of its manpower from there, though membership is open to Catholics from around the world. This will surely strengthen the position of Catholic rulers everywhere.;;;;;;;;;x
