# City of Wonders DESC;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
wonder_city_of_wonders1_desc;[target_province.GetName] has been expanded into a proper city, but there still much to do. Many older buildings have been demolished to make room for many of the new districts that shall contain many of this city’s future wonders. Still, there is much to do, as you cannot even visit a single district without seeing it marred by construction work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # Stage 1
wonder_city_of_wonders2_desc;After much time and effort, [target_province.GetName] has turned into something everyone can agree is a Great City. Monuments and decorations have started to mark [target_province.GetName] as something extraordinary. Still, there is much to do, and the city requires quite a few more wonders before it can truly be called a City of Wonders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # Stage 3
wonder_city_of_wonders3_desc;[target_province.GetName] has undeniably become a Metropolis, that is quite possibly not just the center of the realm, but also a epicenter of the region it inhabits. It has by most margins become the most important post of every major trade route in the known world. Many districts have been built, and quite a few great works and monuments have raised. While the city is one of the greatest in the known world, there is still much work and renovations left before the city can reach it's apex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # Stage 6
wonder_city_of_wonders4_desc;[target_province.GetName] has incontestably grown into a fully-fledged Megalopolis, quite conceivably the greatest city ever built. Pedestrians can walk miles without seeing an apparent end to the city. In any district of the city you can find radiant wonders and great works never before seen beyond the city walls. It may have taken a few generations to accomplish this, and cost some blood, sweat, and wealth beyond imagining – but any who walks the beautifully paved streets of [target_province.GetName] agrees that any sacrifice would be worth it for such a magnificent city. It truly has become a City of Wonders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # Stage 9

# wonder_city_of_wonders_roma;The Eternal City;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_roma_desc;While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe. It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs Aeterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called the "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). After the fall of the Western Empire, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### ALEXANDRIA ###
wonder_city_of_wonders_alex;[FromFromFrom.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_alex_desc;Alexandria was founded c. 332 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. Alexandria became an important center of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), the Great Library (the largest in the ancient world), and the Necropolis. Alexandria was one of the most powerful cities of the ancient Mediterranean region, and with careful investment it surely can regain it's former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# wonder_city_of_wonders_anti;The Cradle of Christianity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_anti_desc;Antioch, also known as Antiocheia on the Orontes, is an ancient Greek city located on the eastern side of the Orontes River. During the Romans' rule of the city quite a few wonders were built like the Circus of Antioch modelled after the Circus Maximus in Rome. The city eventually became the third largest city in the Roman Empire. Antioch eventually became a significant center of early Christianity, and is often nicknamed as "The Cradle of Christianity". It also contains a quite prestigious Patriarchial seat in what is often called the Pentarchy.\n\nUnfortunately Antioch's prosperity has lessened over the last few centuries as it found itself precariously situated on the frontline between two hostile great powers - the Christian Byzantine Empire and the Muslim Caliphates. Though, the City of Antiochus has with proper management finally begun to prosper once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_city_of_wonders_jeru_desc;Jerusalem, widely known as 'The Holy City', is considered a holy city by the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Holy City contains many holy sites and buildings like the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and Dome of the Rock.

### BAGHDAD/BABYLON ###
wonder_city_of_wonders_baby;[FromFromFrom.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_baby_desc;[target_province.GetName] lies on a coveted area along the Tigris River, where multiple empires have in the past laid their great capitals. The Seleucid Empire for a short period of time had their capital in Seleuceia (Seleucia-on-Tigris), while the Persians also placed their capital there, but on the other side of the Tigris in Ctesiphon. To the west lies the river of Euphrates, where Babylon once lay. Babylon was once the great capital of Babylonia, and it also briefly became the capital of Alexander the Great's empire. The city contained wonders beyond imagining like the Hanging Gardens, and supposedly at some point the biblical Tower of Babel.\n\nRecently the city of Baghdad was established in the 8th century, and the city quickly became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. The city itself may not be amongst the most ancient and glorious cities just yet, but the heritage of the immediate region the city is located in certainly is. In time the region shall once again become the greatest center of civilization, learning and culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Many older buildings have been demolished to make room for many of the new districts that shall contain many of this city’s future wonders.

wonder_city_of_wonders_delh_construction_desc;By carefully investing in our capital, we can turn it into a magnificent Megalopolis that will outrival any other cities in the world. It shall become a City of Wonders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### ATHENS ###
wonder_city_of_wonders_athens;[FromFromFrom.GetName]: City of Thinkers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_athens_desc;Athens was once the greatest civilization in the world. With thinkers and merchants alike from all across the ancient world bringing their wealth and knowledge. Athenians still dreams of a day when that can be again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_athens_restored_desc;Glory! Glory to Athens and her people! Once again the city of Athena stands as a shining beacon of learning and commerce. Let all the people know, that the Athenians stands strong, and that their minds as sharp as their spears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_athens_construction_desc;Athens stand at the precipice of greatness. Like their ancient forebears, the city rises to the heights of glory. Yet there is still much work to be done if the Athenians are to show the world the true glory of Athens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### PARSA/PERSEPOLIS ###
wonder_city_of_wonders_parsa;Parsa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_parsa_desc;The city of Parsa, which was known to the west as Persepolis, once stood as the cultural capital of the Achaemenid Empire, and it should be restored to this position once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_parsa_ruined_desc;Ruins are all that remains of the cultural heart of these lands. Parsa, or more widely known as Persepolis, was once the home of Achaemenid Kings. Burned by Alexander the Accursed, it once housed the holy texts of Zoroastrianism, as well as some of the most beautiful gardens in the world.\n\nMaybe, one day, those gardens can be planted again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_parsa_reconstructed_desc;The city stands once more, but she is no longer the heart of this great land. If she is to beat once more, much work must be done to show the world that the ancient glory of the Achaemenids is not lost, but merely forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_parsa_restored_desc;She breathes again! Her great palaces stand tall, and her gardens sing with birds and water. The great Palace of Ten Thousand Timbers rises high once more, and the Grand Pairidaeza stands proudly as a land of beauty in the arid highlands of central Persia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_parsa_construction_desc;The timbers start to rise, the cloth shades whip in the wind, and the first trees are planted. In spite of the harsh climate, and rough terrain, the process to transform this land like the ancients of old has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_city_of_wonders_carth;Qart Hadasht;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_carth_desc;A true gem, the city of Carthage which was once a beacon of civilization, one to rival that of Rome. The Carthaginians would see her brought back to that glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_carth_ruined_desc;Rubble and ruins, that is all that remains of both the ancient capital of Qart Hadasht, and the Roman colony of Carthago. In spite of her long dead nature, her ruins still inspire some with glory.\n\nIf Carthage is restored, she might still fully reclaim her former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_carth_reconstructed_desc;The ruins have been cleaned, and the fallen stones stacked once more. However, all of the Carthaginians' work has done little to truly restore Carthage to her former glory. There is still much work to do if Carthage is to be brought back from the ashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_carth_restored_desc;Let the city of Merchant Kings rule the waves once more. From her large apartments that can house dozens of families, to her massive Cothon that houses enough warships to make Venice tremble, let Carthage once again be the capital of Commerce in the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_carth_construction_desc;Much work has been done, and new great buildings rise. Soon, the world will know, and marvel, at the glory of Carthage. A city that shall reclaim her crown as the Grandest City on the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### SYRACUSE ###
wonder_city_of_wonders_syra;[FromFromFrom.GetName]: City of Arkhimedes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_syra_desc;The city of Syracuse. Once was she the capital of a wealthy kingdom, while now she's just a pale shadow of herself. Perhaps one day will the Syracusians restore her to the proper, and rightful, splendor she once had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_syra_ruined_desc;Here lies the ruins of one of the greatest cities of antiquity, Syracuse. Syracusians hopes that they can restore her beauty, her glory, one day. However, that is all but a distant dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_syra_reconstructed_desc;No longer does Syracuse lie in ruins, no longer do ancient wise men weep in their graves. Syracuse stands tall once again, and although not restored to her former glory, she is already on the verge of power..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_syra_restored_desc;Syracuse stand proudly as the 'Jewel of the Mediterranean' once more. From her great ramparts, protected by the Mirrors of Archimedes, to the grand harbor that once welcomed ships from all across the known world to her ports. Syracuse shines, once again, as a bright beacon of civilization in the west!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_syra_construction_desc;Rising from the waves like a pearl in the sea, Syracuse shines upon the horizon. Her white marble towers gleam under the warm sun, as people from across the world start to see the glory she could be. There's still much work to be done, but the former heart of Mediterranean Commerce has begun to beat once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### CORDOBA ###
wonder_city_of_wonders_cord;[FromFromFrom.GetName]: The Ornament of the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_cord_desc;Cordoba is, and has been for some time, considered a gem amongst cities. With a fusion of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish cultures, the city of Cordoba is the center of scholarly debate throughout the west. A greater beacon against the encroaching darkness of the medieval world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_cord_completed_desc;Jewels of the wealthiest merchants, writings of the greatest scholars, temples of the grandest design. All of these pale in comparison to the beauty, tranquility, and prestige that is Cordoba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_city_of_wonders_cord_construction_desc;Mosques, Temples, Churches, all of them rise up to touch the sky. With the vast wealth garnered from trade, and the grand armies of the Sultan protecting the lands, Cordoba is rising up to the heavens as a grand display of our wealth and prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
