indian_feudal_desc;The event resulted in a collapse of the central government's authority in the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, the remnants of the government managed to survive the event in isolated regions, and soon became much more feudal in structure, with ministers effectively having the power of monarchs. It is primarily focused around moving power upwards to the ducal, kingly and imperial levels by treating the lowest of vassals in a manner more akin to regional governors than true feudal vassals. Compared to feudal states, the ruler is somewhat restricted by the rule of law when dealing with their vassals.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TITLE_laskandar_restoration;Arin's Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_laskandar_restoration;Originally a minor ruler in Maharashtra, Arin of Bandra found inspiration in the tales of a certain pre-event emperor called Shivaji, whose empire is said to have stretched from sea to sea. At a relatively young age, he managed to subjugate the lands of western Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. As time wore on, parts of his realm gradually broke away until only Rajasthan remained, and that too was gone upon his death. It seemed unlikely that anyone would become worthy of the title "Chhatrapati" again. Nevertheless, you have remade Arin's shattered realm, and it is said that rulers across the subcontinent regard you  with fear and awe. It is clear now that Arin lives on in the blood of his descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TITLE_mumbai_triumphant;Mumbai, Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mumbai_triumphant;Ever since the coast of Maharashtra was conquered by Yunaneshwar Desai, Mumbai has remained in a desperate situation. The nobles that still remained after the war with the king fled to the city, and elected a new ruler to be their protector against further incursions. Partly due to its location in the middle of a major trade route, the ruling class soon turned to more mercantile pursuits, and Mumbai grew rich. Of course, the newly crowned Desai king, son of the conquering Yunaneshwar and a victor in a brief civil war, thought that this wealth would be better off in his hands. The protector of Mumbai was out of options, so he negotiated an annual tribute to the King in return for leaving them alone. But now, everything has changed. Mumbai has come to rule its old lands, and it can finally claim to be a worthy successor to the old kingdom of the Samudra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The process takes hours, but when it finally ends, an announcer proclaims the number of votes you have received to the waiting crowd. The exact number of votes doesn't matter: what does is the fact that you were lawfully chosen by the people to govern them.\n\nOnce the crowd has dispersed, you turn to face your vassals gathered before you. You swear an oath affirming your duty towards the realm, and they collectively swear an oath of loyalty to you. Finally, an official places a golden crown on your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
