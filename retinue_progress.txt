Ideas:
1)Romanians or Transnistrians as a whole 
2)Falxmen
3)heavy infantry with +20% morale, attack and defense
4)Seeing how protochronistic romanians are irl and the sheer amount of falx replicas there are around nowadays due to it,it's not unlikely people would find out small bits of these legendary "dacians" that couldn't die and used said falxes and decide to use them as well,finding them to be quite lethally effective (since it's classified as a sword or pike normally but it's effectively a warscythe,and those are bloody terrifying)

1)Culture - Armenian and Georgian
2)Unit Name - Caucasian Cataphracts
3)Troops - 150 Heavy Cav, 100 Light Cav.
+10% Heavy Cavalry Offense
+10% Heavy Cavalry Defense
+20% Heavy Cavalry Morale
4)Reason - Armenia and Georgia historically used Cataphracts often, being heavily influenced militarily by the Cataphracts of Byzantium and Iran.

1)Culture - Romani
2)Unit Name - Romani Patriots
3)Troops - 100 Archers, 150 Pikemen
4)Reason - The Romani are a well travelled people and have suffered persecution in the past, and to me it makes sense that if they finally had a country of their own they'd defend it tooth and nail from outside aggressors, by any means deemed necessary.
5)Retinue Building: Patriot Gathering - a Gathering ground of various Romani travellers, selling various goods to the settled population here and providing ample defence and volunteers in times of war.(slight economic bonuses in exchange for less retinue cap from it than a normal retinue building+less units?)

1) Korean
2) Male ruler - Hwarang; Female ruler - Wonhwa
3) Troops - Horse Archers, Archers
VERY high morale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwarang)

Alternative:
1) Koryo-Saram
2) Gapsa
3) Pikemen (20% offense, 20% defense, 40% morale, just like Italian Pike)
4) Kindly explained by some guy on the Korean subreddit: "Gapsa is the name for professional soldiers of Joseon dynasty who passed the military exam and received a government stipend to train as a standing army. (as opposed to conscripted soldiers, and officers who passed the exam with high marks)" here is the link to the post, for those interested, the comment in question is way down though: https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/g9gdf0/youngshin_from_the_netflix_series_kingdom_was_a/
5) Gaspa Garrison/Barracks

Name: Tzofim
Type of retinue: light infantry 
Building Name: Machane Tzofim ("Tzofim Camp" in Hebrew) 
Description: The Tzofim (meaning "Watchers") are an ancient order of youth vigilantes and other volunteers set on fighting crime and foreign incursions. Due to their deep connection to the Land of Israel, they have more loyalty to their homes than to their King. They usually guard villages near the border from bandits but volunteer to fight for their homeland in times of need.
