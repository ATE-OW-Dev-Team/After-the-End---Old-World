# I tried using on_yearly_pulse.
# I wasn't happy with the precision, and also it seemed to maybe fire too often?
# So, instead, let's try using a bunch of on_actions to start, and 30-day event timers to continue.

# Might now be an attacker in a civil war
on_war_started             = { events = { FitnaFracture.1 } }  # Forward #2 to the attacker (FROM)
on_new_holder              = { events = { FitnaFracture.2 } }
on_new_holder_inheritance  = { events = { FitnaFracture.2 } }
on_new_holder_usurpation   = { events = { FitnaFracture.2 } }

# Might no longer be an attacker in a civil war
on_war_ended_victory       = { events = { FitnaFracture.6 } }  # Forward #7 to the attacker (FROM)
on_war_ended_whitepeace    = { events = { FitnaFracture.6 } }  # Forward #7 to the attacker (FROM)
on_war_ended_defeat        = { events = { FitnaFracture.6 } }  # Forward #7 to the attacker (FROM)

# In case we missed something above, try to rectify it eventually
on_startup                 = { events = { FitnaFracture.2  FitnaFracture.7 } }
on_yearly_pulse            = { events = { FitnaFracture.2  FitnaFracture.7 } }
