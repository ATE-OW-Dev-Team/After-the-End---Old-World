damaged_cybernetics_desc;This character's cybernetic augmentations have been damaged. Besides rendering their cybernetics less useful, this is also a general health hazard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dni;Direct Neural Interface;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dni_desc;The Direct Neural Interface, colloquially called a "skulltop," is the basic neural implant on which all neural cybernetics are based. The DNI consists of a miniature computer implant in the host's brain, directly connected to their neurons. It acts as an interpreter between human neural processing and more conventional computer signals, allowing additional subsequent implants to interact with the brain. Nearly all modern DNI designs also include a microwave transmission device allowing direct wireless connection to computer networks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10000;Your implants are certainly convenient, but you're starting to wonder if maybe they're TOO convenient. You've come to rely on them more and more. Perhaps you should try using them more conservatively, to make sure you don't become too reliant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10000;Why bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10000;I could certainly use the exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10005;You've begun to grow tired of your routine lovemaking, and hit upon the idea of making a wireless connection between your brain and your partner's. You'd both experience each others' pleasure, simultaneously.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10005;I just hope it won't get out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10006;Your nightly routine had started to get stale, before [From.GetFirstName] suggested you try leaving your implants connected. Feeling [From.GetHerHis] pleasure as well as your own was an amazing experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10006;We need to do that again sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10007;Last night, [From.GetFirstName] suggested that the two of you spice up your usual nightly activities by leaving your implants on and connected. The idea was that you'd feel [From.GetHerHis] pleasure, while [From.GetSheHe]'d feel yours. It worked. Perhaps a little too well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10007;Who am I again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10011;You've made an important discovery. As part of your security duties, you hacked into [From.GetFullName]'s DNI, and discovered that [From.GetSheHe] is planning to [From.GetPlot]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10011;I'll need to do something about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10015;You haven't been maintaining your cybernetic limb properly recently. The metal is starting to get rusty at the point where prosthetic meets flesh, and it's cutting into your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10015;Ow ow ow ow ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10020;Each night, you lie in bed, thinking. It's strange, being half machine. The other children seem different now, more alien, as if you aren't human anymore. You're starting to wonder if you can ever get used to life like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10022;You tried to talk to your [GetFromRelation] about how you've been feeling lately, but [From.GetSheHe] just ignored you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10022;I'll just have to deal with it on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10023;You asked your [GetFromRelation] about how you'd been feeling lately. [From.GetSheHeCap] didn't seem mad, but all [From.GetSheHe] could say was things like 'just be yourself' or 'being a cyborg doesn't matter.' [From.GetSheHeCap] had no idea what [From.GetSheHe] was talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10023;You're just lying to make me feel better!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10024;Your [GetFromRelation] was kind and understanding. [From.GetSheHeCap] talked to you for a few hours about your new condition, and you feel like you might be able to handle it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10024;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10025;Talking to your [GetFromRelation] was the right thing to do. [From.GetSheHeCap] took you aside for a few hours and told you that you don't need to ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10030;You long to [Root.GetAmbition], but how can you possibly hope to compete with that THING that currently occupies the position? It can do in instants things that would take a real person months. The damn thing thinks it's BETTER than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10030;Frakking wireheads.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10030;I'll show that thing what a real flesh-and-blood human can do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10035;You'd been vaguely aware that [From.GetFullName] was after your job for some time now, but after last night's general conference you think [From.GetSheHe] might be taking it just a bit too personally. The words 'toaster' and 'wirehead' were mentioned.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10035;Small-minded fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10041;It's just not fair! You try as hard as you can, work as hard as you can, but [From.GetFirstName] is always one step ahead of you. It's that stupid machine! Without one, how are you supposed to keep up?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10041;I'm not playing with [From.GetHerHim] anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10041;Maybe I should just ask [From.GetHerHim] to play fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCYBERNETICS10041;I should get a machine like that, too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDCYBERNETICS10041;I'll show that cheater who's boss!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCYBERNETICS10042;will be very upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10042;[From.GetFirstName] is such a jerk! [From.GetSheHeCap] won't play with you anymore, just because [From.GetSheHe]'s jealous of how much better you are than [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that using your implants is cheating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10042;Oh yeah? Is THIS cheating?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10042;No big loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10043;When you told [From.GetFirstName] that you weren't going to play with [From.GetHerHim] anymore, [From.GetSheHe] got angry and punched you! A servo caught some of your skin and now you're bleeding. What a jerk!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10043;Stupid toaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10044;[From.GetFirstName] asked you if you could turn off your implants when you play games. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it's not fair to the kids without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10044;I'm sorry, I had no idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10044;You're just jealous that I'm better than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCYBERNETICS10045;is grateful;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10045;It looks like all you really had to do was ask. [From.GetFirstName] agreed that [From.GetHerHis] implants gave [From.GetHerHim] an unfair advantage, and [From.GetSheHe] promised [From.GetSheHe]'d keep them switched off in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10045;[From.GetSheHeCap]'s not so bad after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10046;You're not really sure why you thought that would work. [From.GetFirstName] just laughed at you and accused you of being jealous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10046;What a jerk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10047;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] wants you to buy [From.GetHerHim] a Direct Neural Interface. "[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has one!' [From.GetSheHe] says, 'and [FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s always beating me at everything. It's not fair! I should get one, too!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10047;Well, I suppose it couldn't be that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10047;Absolutely not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10048;Your [GetFromRelation] agreed to buy you a DNI. You had to be anesthetized for the surgery, and you were pretty dizzy for the whole ride home, but now you have a computer in your head. It's pretty cool!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10048;This oughtta even the odds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10049;This is outrageous! You trusted [From.GetFullName] to look after [FromFrom.GetFirstName], but now the monster has had some sort of mechanical monstrosity installed in your child's head!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10049;How dare you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10050;Grown-ups are so frustrating! You tried to explain everything to your [GetFromRelation], but [From.GetSheHe] stubbornly refused to let you have a DNI.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10050;How am I going to keep up now?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10060;Your cybernetics have sustained considerable damage, and even using them to the extent you'd use a natural body part is difficult. It's an odd sensation, feeling no pain in a limb that is so clearly broken. Repairs may take some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10060;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10061;Your cybernetics have finally been properly repaired. Apparently the damage, while extensive, was largely superficial. You let out a sigh of relief that you don't have to send them back to the lab.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10061;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10062;There's no sensation of pain. If not for the terrible noise, you might not even have noticed. You simply had a functional arm attached to your shoulder one second, and a useless piece of scrap metal the next. The damage looks like it's beyond repair. You'll have to replace the entire limb.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10062;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10063;There's no sensation of pain. If not for the terrible noise and the loss of balance, you might not even have noticed. You simply had a functional leg attached to your hip one second, and a useless piece of scrap metal the next. The damage looks like it's beyond repair. You'll have to replace the entire limb.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10063;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10064;Oh god. Oh god, it hurts. Your back buckles and your spine twists. A jagged shard of titanium bursts out from your forearm. You try to move, and the screaming takes you. It's as if you're bound by your own skeleton, trapped in a cage of iron and misery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10064;Aaaaagh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10070;Your new cybernetic body naturally comes with a full suite of cybernetic body parts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10100;You've been given the option to participate in a beta test for the next generation of software drivers for your Individual Analysis and Empathy Implant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10100;Count me in!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10100;You're kidding, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10101;The beta test for your IAEI is now over. The data you gathered was put to good use, and the new software you tested has greatly improved your IAEI's functionality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10101;So it was all worth it in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10102;This beta-test hasn't exactly been smooth, but in the times when you CAN get your IAEI to function perfectly, it seems to work better than ever. You even think you might be starting to pick up some new skills of your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10102;At the very least, I know what DOESN'T work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10105;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s decision to call you in for a meeting took you completely by surprise. Normally, that might not have been such a bad thing, but your IAEI had been glitchier than usual today, and you MAY have accidentally insulted [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] parents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10105;NO WAIT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10106;You'd called [From.GetFullName] in for a meeting, and things had gotten off to a steady-but-rocky start when [From.GetSheHe] suddenly made some EXTREMELY rude comments about your parentage. You immediately narrow your eyes, and [From.GetSheHe] immediately widens [From.GetHerHis]s, waving [From.GetHerHis] hands and spluttering something about an IAEI beta test.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10106;...sure, let's go with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS5000;The installation of your Direct Neural Interface was successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS5060;You look down at your hand and unfurl your fingers, feeling the subtle sensation of joints clicking into place. It isn't the same as the real thing. It's cold to the touch, and your sense of touch is softer, as if it was really happening to someone else. But it will do the job all the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
