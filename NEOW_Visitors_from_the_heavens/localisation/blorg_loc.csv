blorg1Desc;The completely unthinkable has happened! Ships have descended from the sky at (insert location here) carrying creatures that are certainly not human. Calling themselves the "Blorg Commonality", using a device to translate their alien words into something understandable, the Blorg say that they have arrived at Earth to spread benevolence and tolerance. Obviously, many people still mistrust those visitors from the heavens, they'll have to be tolerated for now as they don't seem intent on starting wars anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;x;;;
