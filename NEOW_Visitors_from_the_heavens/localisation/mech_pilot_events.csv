EVTDESCbuy_mech.1;You have purchased a Commander Key, allowing you to pilot a Combat Mech Suit. Be careful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.1;This is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCbuy_mech.2;You have sent a messenger to purchase and bring to you a Combat Mech Suit for your own personal use. There are many Zhao Rangers on the market, and for the right price you have acquired one for yourself. You anxiously await its delivery to you at the gates of [Root.Capital.GetName], but even still as it arrives you can't help but almost faint. Two stories tall, wide, golden, with claws the size of an ox and creaking ungodly noises from its orifices, your Zhao Ranger Mech Suit is as fearsome as you had hoped it would look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.2;I will dominate the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buy_mech.3;Red Fighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCbuy_mech.3;You meet your contact, a Cetinese trader with a mechanic eye, at a hangar not too far from your capital. "They're masterworks, all. You can't go wrong," he says as he unveils his 'toys' for you to see. He presents to you a tall metal hulk, a beastly giant iron almost in the shape of a man, its exterior harder than any sword you've felt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.3;I want that one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buy_mech.4;AP-6 STRIKER;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCbuy_mech.4;The AP-6 STRIKER is the most advanced Mech Suit made with the material available on Mars. Its defensive capabilities and foreign armaments make it impossible to defeat on the battlefield. You have invested a lot of gold and time, and now your STRIKER has finally arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.4;The world is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.1;Your [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has asked you to entrust one of your spare Mech Suits to [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. "A man can only pilot one at a time themselves," [FromFrom.GetSheHe] reminds you...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.1;Hopefully you don't don't use it against me...;;;x
EVTOPTBsuit_events.1;I would rather not.;;;x

EVTTITsuit_events.0;Mind and Body;;;x
EVTDESCsuit_events; With each engagement you get better and better at fighting inside your Mech suit. However, Piloting an Armored Mech Suit is heavily taxing on the human body. Due to having to connect to the pilot's spine every use, over time the Mech Suit can kill its pilot.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.0;Such is life.;;;x
suitevt1;Piloting your Mech Suit takes a toll on your health.;;;x
EVTOPTBsuit_events.0;I was born for this!;;;x
suitevt2;You are unaffected by your suit's life draining mechanics;;;x
EVTOPTCsuit_events.0;I am one with my Machine!;;;x
suitevt3;Unlike most pilots, you are unaffected by the drawbacks of extensive fighting. You are more closely bonded with your Mech Suit.;;;x
good_pilot;Experienced Pilot;;;x
good_pilot_desc;This character handles their Mech Suit well.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.2;As an Emperor, it simply will not do to pilot a standard Mech Suit like every other Commander. No, you have tasked your researchers with developing an AP-6 STRIKER. At last, their construction is complete and you can now pilot her yourself if you can handle it...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.2;All will bow to me!;;;x
suitevt4;Your Mech Suit is scrapped to build an AP-6 STRIKER;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.3;In the heat of battle, you and your men encounter your enemy [roboduel.GetFirstName]'s Mech Suit wreaking great havoc among your lines. Unlike anything you've ever seen, the creature kills scores of men with just one swoop of its gigantic metal claws. Watching your men demoralized and fleeing, you contemplate going for a charge...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.3;No, that would be too dangerous.;;;x
EVTOPTBsuit_events.3; May [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] guide my sword to victory. Charge!!!;;;x
suitevt5;You charge forward and face the metal beast on your own.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.4;By the grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], you managed to narrowly dodge an attack from the metal demon, ramming your lance right into where it hides its master. The beast groans and staggers, ejecting its master [roboduel.GetFirstName] from its chest and falling to pieces.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.4;Men will sing songs of this day for years to come!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.5;Before you could make it to the beast, one sweep of its claw knocks you off your horse and flings you into the air. You land on your back, a great distance from where you once were, alive, but badly injured.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.5;My leg...!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.6;By the grace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], you managed to narrowly dodge an attack from the metal demon, ramming your lance right into where it hides its master. The beast groans and staggers. As you pull your lance away, you realize you have impaled the beast's master [roboduel.GetFirstName] and killed [roboduel.GetHerHim]. It is now yours to claim.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.6;To the victor, the spoils...;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.7;You have summoned all of the greatest minds in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to begin construction of a Red Fighter Mech Suit. The head engineer insists that they will need about a year.;;;x
EVTAsuit_events.7;Best of luck, gentlemen.;;;x
EVTBsuit_events.7;Actually, let's wait.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.8;Your engineers have come to you with the most exciting news! They were able to gather all of the resources and knowledge to craft a Red Fighter Mech Suit. They wheel the giant metal monstrosity up to your castle on a metal platform wheeled by over a dozen ox..;;;x
EVTsuit_events.8;Now my reign truly begins!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.9;Your engineers claim that their attempts to build a Mech Suit have been unsuccessful. Many of them have returned home in frustration and will not work on it any further...;;;x
EVTsuit_events.9;Damn it... We must try again!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.10;You have summoned all of the greatest minds in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to begin construction of a Zhao Ranger Mech Suit. The head engineer insists that they will need about a year.;;;x
EVTAsuit_events.10;Do not disappoint me, men.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.11;Your engineers have come to you with the most exciting news! They were able to gather all of the resources and knowledge to craft a Zhao Ranger Mech Suit. They wheel the giant metal monstrosity up to your castle on a metal platform wheeled by over a dozen ox..;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.12;Your engineers claim that their attempts to build a Mech Suit have been unsuccessful. Many of them have returned home in frustration and will not work on it any further...;;;x


EVTDESCbuild_mech.1;In order to pilot a MS, you must first bind yourself to one to adjust your body to its automatic controls. There is a chance that your body may reject the machine if it is incompatible which could potentially injure you.;;;x


EVTOPTBbuild_mech.1;I am ready.;;;x
suitevt7;Attempt to bond with your MS.;;;x
EVTOPTAbuild_mech.1;Let's do this another day...;;;x

EVTDESCbuild_mech.2;You enter your Mech Suit's cockpit, and sit in its center. Without warning, a metal pin quickly lodges itself in the back of your neck. The sudden pain shocks you, but you remain still. After a few silent seconds, your Mech Suit begins to awaken with lights blinking. You notice as your arms move, so do the machine's...;;;x
EVTOPTbuild_mech.2;Amazing...!;;;x


EVTDESCbuild_mech.3;For reasons you don't understand, the Mech Suit will not respond to you. As you sit in its jaws, nothing happens and your courtiers look to you confused.;;;x
EVTOPTbuild_mech.3;I'll have to try again.;;;x

EVTDESCbuild_mech.4;The Mech Suit has refused you. Once you entered its jaws, it grabbed you with its tongue and yanked at your neck as if it meant to decapitate you. You narrowly escape its jaws with your life...;;;x
EVTbuild_mech.4;Curses!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events13;In the Midst of battle in your Mech Suit, a feeling you cannot describe overcomes you. All you see is red and it is as if the machine you are piloting is not a tool, but an extension of yourself...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.13;DEATH DEATH DEATH!!!;;;X
suitevt13;You go on a rampage with your Mech Suit, terrorizing all men in your sight and making no distinction between friend and foe.;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.16;As you move on the battlefield in your Mech Suit, a feeling you cannot explain overwhelms you. Without warning, the machine opens up and ejects you from its seat, violently tossing you into midst of the battlefield. When you look back, the machine seems to be in flames...;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.16;Aaargh...! Damn it!;;;x
suitevt16;Your Mech Suit has rejected you and destroyed itself.;;;x

EVTDESCmechfl_siege.99;Your Mech Suit took quite the tumble on the battlefield. The defenders were more prepared than you initially thought, injuring you and your Mech Suit before you fled back to your camp.;;;x
EVTOPTAmechfl_siege.99;Tis' but a flesh wound!;;;x

EVTDESCsuit_events.17;You are marching with your army though [Root.Location.GetName] in your Mech Suit when suddenly and without warning the machine ceases to respond to you. It flashes a warning to you and then opens up and violently ejects you from its seat.;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.17;Ouch! What does 'error' mean...?;;;x
suitunbond;Your Mech Suit has rejected you. There is a chance it may be unusable now..;;;x

EVTDESCbuild_mech.5;After failing to bond with your Mech Suit, it seems to have began rapidly falling apart. None of your scientists or learned men can explain how or why, but the machine is no longer in usable condition...;;;x
EVTOPTbuild_mech.5;I can at least sell the parts for scrap...;;;x

suit_events.18;Meddling Spacers;;;x
EVTDESCsuit_events.18;Spacers delegates from the Tau Ceti Empire monitoring ongoing conflicts have decided to smuggle a Mech Suit to the leading rebel group in [From.Location.GetName]. If able to master it, this may turn the war in their favor!;;;x
EVTOPTAsuit_events.18;That doesn't sound good...;;;x
EVTOPTBsuit_events.18;Damn them!;;;x
