EVTNAMEYUGO1;Crisis of Authority;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO1;The Yugoslavist religion has always been an uncomfortable compromise, intended to secure religious peace in the Balkans at last. At no point have many people actually believed in this syncretic admixture of Christianity and Islam, but most people have been persuaded to go along with the charade. Recently, however, a zealous preacher has been drawing crowds of followers by preaching loudly that the Truth is more important than Peace,  and that we cannot simply blaspheme the Word of God,  even if doing so lessens the spilling of blood. [Root.GetTitledName] has condemned the man, but few heed him. All eyes wait for the Emperor to intervene, for it is his duty to support the Yugoslavist faith, and without him, it is unlikely to weather this storm.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.1;I will throw my full weight behind [Root.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.1;This is a Church matter, so the Church should deal with it.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.1;The preacher is right - I've had enough of this charade too.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.1;Trouble is brewing?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.1;Trouble in the Balkans? Does this really count as news?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO2;The Battle Plan;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO2;Now that you have decided to support the Propiciater against the rebels, you should think about how precisely you intend to deal with this problem. The preacher and his associates are rapidly gaining followers, and we must act quickly if we are to stem this tide.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.2;Ban his movement and arrest his followers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.2;Write and disseminate a theological treatise thoroughly refuting him;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.2;On second thoughts, this seems hard. Just give a token statement of support.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO3;Mild Discontent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO3;Your efforts have borne fruit - the preacher's followers have started to dry up, and it seems that people are slowly coming around to your way of seeing things. While it will take many decades for peace to truly return, all you have to do now is wait out the rebels.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.3;This is about as good as we could've hoped for.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO4;A Fire of Discontent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO4;Your attempts have been successful - in part. You have managed to stamp out the worst centres of the rebellion, but they retain widespread popular support, and your actions have alienated the commonfolk. It will be many years before this settles down, and who knows what his followers might be inspired to do in the meantime?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.4;We will endure this.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO5;A Firestorm of Discontent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO5;Disaster! Your attempts to counteract the preacher have completely backfired, and now his teachings are spreading all over the Empire! You'll have to hold on for dear life if you want to survive...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.5;Why did we even start this stupid religion?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO6;The Truth, At Last;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO6;Finally, you have the opportunity to rid yourself of the ghastly joke that is Yugoslavism. But what religion do you truly follow, then?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.6;The Holy Orthodox Faith.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.6;The Holy Catholic Faith;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.6;I follow the words of the Prophet;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO8;Triumph of Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO8;Despite the challenges that it has faced, the Yugoslavist faith has stood resolute, never allowing the forces of sedition or rebellion to overwhelm it. By now, the energies of the rebels have been exhausted, and people have come to accept that the faith will not be gotten rid of. This represents a major shift, as the people of the Balkans are now more or less content to let the Yugoslavist church rule over them, at least in the public sphere. In addition, for the first time, groups of people who seem to sincerely believe in Yugoslavism have come forth, and have established religious communities and making themselves part of Balkan life. Perhaps in the future, Yugoslavism will no longer be treated as a joke?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.8;A Triumph Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.8;We'll finally have peace now.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.8;Our poor Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.8;May Allah destroy them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.8;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO9;Survival of Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO9;Despite the challenges that it has faced, the Yugoslavist faith has stood resolute. Despite the chaos that has consumed the Balkans, it has maintained its hold over the core of the Empire, and people are now willing to, at the very least, go back to pretending to believe in it publically.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.9;A Triumph Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.9;We'll finally have peace now.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.9;Our poor Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.9;May Allah destroy them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.9;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO10;Death of Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO10;It is finally over. The sham church established by the Yugoslavian Emperor is finished. Nobody attends its ceremonies, instead flocking to Churches and Mosques. Nobody listens to [Root.GetTitledName]'s pronouncements, and even the Empire itself is no longer formally Yugoslavist. Today, [Root.GetTitledName], seeing the complete lack of relevance that Yugoslavism had to the Balkans, formally laid down his symbols of office, and resigned. Nobody appointed a successor.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.10;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.10;What a horrible tragedy!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTE_yugoslav.10;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO11;Crusader Kings;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO11;In recent years, the Yugoslavist religion has been greatly strengthened by the actions of wise and faithful rulers. The faith's power has grown so much that [Root.GetTitledName] has decided that they should direct their efforts outwards, for the world is still filled with heathen darkness, and the Yugoslavist faithful must bring the light to these benighted souls. This marks the beginning of a new era, when Yugoslavists will go on Crusade.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTB_yugoslav.11;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESCYUGO12;You have decided to take no action against the troublesome preachers. Whatever happens now is entirely out of your hands.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.12;So be it;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO13;The Car Demands Your Obedience;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO13;With the triumph of the Yugoslavist religion, [From.GetTitledName] has ordered that all of his subjects should convert, and give up their old faiths. No leeway is given in this matter - anyone who refuses to convert will be considered the enemy of the Crown.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.13;I will accept Yugoslavism.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.13;I will say the words, but I will keep my true faith in secret.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.13;Never!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO15;Order of St Tito;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO15;With the consolidation of the Yugoslavist faith, monastic orders have been formed for the defense and propagation of the religion. One of these is a group of pious knights who have joined together for the defense of Yugoslavism against its many enemies. They refuse to fight other Yugoslavists, and work tirelessly to defend the faithful from their many enemies.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.15;At last we have our own protectors.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.15;They are still infidels!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nobelian7Desc;As the sacred steam fills your lungs, your head swims with otherworldly visions. But these do not reveal useful secrets, but horrifying and unsettling images.

nobelian8Desc;As you prepare to enter the sacred sauna, your Mentor stops you.

Motes of the dream escape from your memory practically every second, but you immediately write down as much of what you were told as you can remember.

##Jojo Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO1;The Phantom of Blood;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO1;You are Jonathan Joestar, only son of the noble George. When you were very young, a commoner saved your father's life, and in gratitude your father raised that man's son as his own. This was your adoptive brother, Dio Brando. Yet Dio did not show gratitude to his benefactor, but instead plotted to torment you and usurp your own life, even trying to poison your father and blame you for the crime! You recently discovered his duplicity and, with the aid of your new friend Robert Speedwagon, confronted him. He managed to escape, despite having been shot seemingly-fatally by crossbow bolts. Now, he has taken control of the small castle known as Knight's Lot, and is plotting some new nefarious scheme. You must stop Dio before he ruins any more lives!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.1;I'll make you cry like a baby, Dio!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO2;The End;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO2;After storming Dio's castle, you find your wicked half-brother gloating there," mocking you. "You're too late"," Jojo!" he says. "I've already thrown away my humanity! Now I will live forever!" Unfazed", you draw your sword and swing mightily, cleaving a deep blow through his head! You've won! But then, to your shock," Dio begins to laugh. "Didn't I already tell you that I am no longer human?" To your amazement", he begins to push the two halves of his severed head back together, and they begin to heal! He grabs hold of you, and you begin to feel your strength draining out of you! Thinking quickly, you push forward, towards the edge of the high castle parapet that you are dueling on. Before he realises what is happening, you both tumble off, into the night. With your free hand, you grab onto a protruding tree branch, arresting your fall. Dio, his grip loosened by shock, plummets past you, screaming curses of eternal vengenace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_jojo.2;Goodbye, Dio;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO3;Jonathan has defeated you. Sunken deep into the ocean, you barely manage to survive by locking yourself inside a coffin. You will have to remain here, drifting at the mercy of the waves, until someone happens upon your sunken tomb. Until then, all you can do is wait, and brood.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.3;One day I will extinguish the Joestar bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO4;A Joyful Victory;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO4;Victory! With your triumph over your wicked half-brother Dio, you have avenged the death of your father and the Joestar family name. At last, you may have some peace and quiet, as is your reward. But what could Dio have meant when he said he was no longer human? Could he truly be still alive?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.4;If he ever returns, the Joestars will be ready.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO5;Stardust Crusaders;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO5;At last, the time has come. An African fisherman has fished up your floating coffin, and opened it. After swiftly killing him and his companions, you stretch out your body, stiff beyond measure after a century of confinement. Throughout the years, one thought alone has kept you sane - revenge on the Joestar bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTAJOJO5;Do you believe in Gravity?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO6;The Memory of Your Bloodline;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO6;Out of nowhere, you feel a sudden chill, as if your whole body were suddenly blasted by a harsh winter wind. You ask the members of your family, and they also report that the same thing happened to them at the same time. Nobody else in your court was affected, only your family members. What could this ominous feeling mean?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.6;This dread runs in my very veins...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO9;Assassin Attack!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO9;It has been several months now since you felt that strange chill in your blood, and you had forgotten all about it. One day, while getting dressed, you notice one of the servants enter the room. You asked them to help you, but to your surprise, they drew a weapon on you! "Hail, Lord DIO! I do this for you!";;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.9;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_jojo.9;Trick them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO10;The End;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO10;You struggle valiantly, but the assassin gets the better of you. As you feel the blade sink into your chest, you wonder why all of this had to happen...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.10;No...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO11;Reprieve;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO11;After a desperate struggle, you manage to throw off your attacker. Your guards arrive at last, and quickly dispose of the assassin.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.11;Thank goodness;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO12;Call To Adventure;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO12;The assassin's body has been disposed of, and normalcy is finally starting to return to the household. After several hours, a servant arrives, bearing an important message. He introduces you to a strange man that you don't recognise. \n "You don't know me, but I know you" he says. "Your ancestor, Jonathan Joestar, killed Dio Brando. But DIO was no longer mortal, he was something...different. After a hundred years, he has returned, and now his fanatical followers seek to exterminate you and everyone else who carries the Joestar blood. I can take you to DIO. This will never end until he is dead, but I will understand if you don't want to take the risk.";;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.12;I will finish Jonathan's work!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_jojo.12;This is too dangerous. Let someone else do it!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO13;An Adventure Most Menacing;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO13;After a harrowing journey, you finally arrive at DIO's mansion in uptown Cairo. The place is filled with a dreadful, terrifying aura, and every step through it is filled with peril. At last, however, you find yourself at the base of a grand golden staircase. At the top, a huge, muscular figure looms in the shadows. \n "Oh, you're approaching me?" he says. You swallow your fear and respond. "I can't kill you without getting closer." He laughs. \n "Oho! Then come as close as you like!";;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.13;This is your end, DIO!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO14;In DIO's World;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO14;DIO's movements are incredibly quick, he seems to appear and disappear with blinding speed. You only have a moment to attack!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.14;One chance is all I need!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO15;End of the World;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO15;In a split second, you see DIO leave a weak point open! You swing with all your might, and your blade strikes true! It bites deep into DIO's leg, causing him to stumble. "I-Impossible!" he cries. "I AM DIO!" You heave mightily, cleaving his entire leg in twain, before pulling your sword back and cutting his head clean off. With his leg crippled, he is unable to block. Strange black fluid pours out of his body, as the ageless DIO finally crumbles. You have finished Jonathan's work, and saved your entire bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.15;At last, it's over;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO16;Useless, Useless, Useless;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO16;You try to swing, but before you can so much as blink, DIO vanishes from your sight. He reappears behind you, and strikes you so hard that you are impaled through the chest by his arm. "Disappointing. I had hoped the Joestar bloodline would prove more of a challenge." Things go black as you collapse to the floor...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sikh1Desc;You dress yourself in the five Sikh articles of faith, The five Pyare, wise men representing the 'beloved volunteers' who bravely followed the Guru into his tent when he created the way of the Khalsa, surround you and explain the meaning of following the Khalsa. You must swear never again to cut your hair, to eat the meat of any animal, to cohabit with anyone other than your spouse, or to use tobacco, alcohol, or any kind of drug. You swear to follow these stipulations throughout all of your life, and a sixth Sikh reads a randomly-chosen passage from the Guru Grant Sahib. You repeat the sacred salutation, and the Pyare mix pure water in an iron bowl using a ceremonial sword. You drink from the bowl, and are fully inducted into the Khalsa.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

religion_feature_folklorist_2_desc;Common legends tell us about our ancestry, the might of old Russia and her champions, such as Black Baron, Golden Admiral Kolchak or Vysotskiy, the wise bard. But there are different kind of legends. They tell us stories much older then the Event, older even then the Motherland herself. These are the stories of our great ancestors, who descended from the stars and had built the God-Like empire of Daaria in the far north, and it is said that for them one year equated to merely one day. Their descendants unified Asia under the thumb of Asgard, or Arkaim, the throne of Gardaria and created Tartary, empire of Tripillians. We, their descendants, have survived the Night of Svarog, and therefore must reclaim our ancestral right to Asia and unify it under the rule of the Rus!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this power is largely ceremonial, and only within his demesne can the monarch exercise his typical sovereign policies. Confederation leaders cannot interfere in the religious policies of their subjects.

A wise and learned Emperor will be needed to restore order.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bhutan3Title;The Dragon Wakes;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bhutan3Desc;Since time out of mind, the small mountain nation of Bhutan has reigned stable and steadfast, seemingly immune to the storms and tribulations of the world. Legends state that even the Event barely touched them, and that much of the wisdom of the Old World is preserved in the great Catacombs beneath Bumthang. To the people of Tibet and India, the Thunder Dragon Empire is simply like the ground beneath a man's feet - he rarely notices it, but he could not imagine it ceasing to exist. \nHowever, long centuries of peace had made the Bhutanese complacent. Their tax system grew inefficient, their scholars ceased to learn anything new, and their army grew rife with nepotism and laziness. That has all changed, however. Over the past few decades, the Emperors have gradually managed to reform their country's ageing systems, and now they have completed their work. With their country once again revitalised, the Thunder Dragon may yet again spread its wings across Eastern Asia...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bhutan5Desc;Bhutan's bureacratic system is highly efficient at administrating land - specifically, the land within Bhutan itself, which they've gotten so used to dealing with that it's often joked that the bureacrats could do their jobs while asleep. Unfortunately, we've found ourselves in possession of land outside of those familiar schema, and they're having a bit of trouble with it. In fact, they are proving frankly incompetent at managing it, and have bungled it horribly. Now the peasants are angry, the taxes aren't being collected, and many within the Empire are starting to wonder if taking this land was worth it in the first place.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
