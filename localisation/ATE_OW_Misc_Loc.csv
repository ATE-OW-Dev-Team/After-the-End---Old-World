EVTNAMEYUGO1;Crisis of Authority;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO1;The Yugoslavist religion has always been an uncomfortable compromise, intended to secure religious peace in the Balkans at last. At no point have many people actually believed in this syncretic admixture of Christianity and Islam, but most people have been persuaded to go along with the charade. Recently, however, a zealous preacher has been drawing crowds of followers by preaching loudly that the Truth is more important than Peace,  and that we cannot simply blaspheme the Word of God,  even if doing so lessens the spilling of blood. [Root.GetTitledName] has condemned the man, but few heed him. All eyes wait for the Emperor to intervene, for it is his duty to support the Yugoslavist faith, and without him, it is unlikely to weather this storm.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.1;I will throw my full weight behind [Root.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.1;This is a Church matter, so the Church should deal with it.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.1;The preacher is right - I've had enough of this charade too.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.1;Trouble is brewing…;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.1;Trouble in the Balkans? Does this really count as news?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO2;The Battle Plan;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO2;Now that you have decided to support the Propiciater against the rebels, you should think about how precisely you intend to deal with this problem. The preacher and his associates are rapidly gaining followers, and we must act quickly if we are to stem this tide.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.2;Ban his movement and arrest his followers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.2;Write and disseminate a theological treatise thoroughly refuting him;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.2;On second thoughts, this seems hard. Just give a token statement of support.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO3;Mild Discontent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO3;Your efforts have borne fruit - the preacher's followers have started to dry up, and it seems that people are slowly coming around to your way of seeing things. While it will take many decades for peace to truly return, all you have to do now is wait out the rebels.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.3;This is about as good as we could've hoped for.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO4;A Fire of Discontent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO4;Your attempts have been successful - in part. You have managed to stamp out the worst centres of the rebellion, but they retain widespread popular support, and your actions have alienated the commonfolk. It will be many years before this settles down, and who knows what his followers might be inspired to do in the meantime?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.4;We will endure this.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO5;A Firestorm of Discontent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO5;Disaster! Your attempts to counteract the preacher have completely backfired, and now his teachings are spreading all over the Empire! You'll have to hold on for dear life if you want to survive...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.5;Why did we even start this stupid religion?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO6;The Truth, At Last;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO6;Finally, you have the opportunity to rid yourself of the ghastly joke that is Yugoslavism. But what religion do you truly follow, then?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.6;The Holy Orthodox Faith.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.6;The Holy Catholic Faith;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.6;I follow the words of the Prophet;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO8;Triumph of Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO8;Despite the challenges that it has faced, the Yugoslavist faith has stood resolute, never allowing the forces of sedition or rebellion to overwhelm it. By now, the energies of the rebels have been exhausted, and people have come to accept that the faith will not be gotten rid of. This represents a major shift, as the people of the Balkans are now more or less content to let the Yugoslavist church rule over them, at least in the public sphere. In addition, for the first time, groups of people who seem to sincerely believe in Yugoslavism have come forth, and have established religious communities and making themselves part of Balkan life. Perhaps in the future, Yugoslavism will no longer be treated as a joke?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.8;A Triumph Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.8;We'll finally have peace now.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.8;Our poor Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_yugoslav.8;May Allah destroy them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_yugoslav.8;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO9;Survival of Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO9;Despite the challenges that it has faced, the Yugoslavist faith has stood resolute. Despite the chaos that has consumed the Balkans, it has maintained its hold over the core of the Empire, and people are now willing to, at the very least, go back to pretending to believe in it publically.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.9;A Triumph Indeed!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.9;We'll finally have peace now.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.9;Our poor Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTE_yugoslav.9;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO10;Death of Yugoslavism;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO10;It is finally over. The sham church established by the Yugoslavian Emperor is finished. Nobody attends its ceremonies, instead flocking to Churches and Mosques. Nobody listens to [Root.GetTitledName]'s pronouncements, and even the Empire itself is no longer formally Yugoslavist. Today, [Root.GetTitledName], seeing the complete lack of relevance that Yugoslavism had to the Balkans, formally laid down his symbols of office, and resigned. Nobody appointed a successor.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.10;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.10;What a horrible tragedy!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTE_yugoslav.10;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO11;Crusader Kings;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO11;In recent years, the Yugoslavist religion has been greatly strengthened by the actions of wise and faithful rulers. The faith's power has grown so much that [Root.GetTitledName] has decided that they should direct their efforts outwards, for the world is still filled with heathen darkness, and the Yugoslavist faithful must bring the light to these benighted souls. This marks the beginning of a new era, when Yugoslavists will go on Crusade.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.11;Our Realm Will Expand!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.11;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.11;These ridiculous syncretists must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAMEYUGO12;The Fickle Finger Of Fate;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO12;You have decided to take no action against the troublesome preachers. Whatever happens now is entirely out of your hands.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.12;So be it;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO13;The Car Demands Your Obedience;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO13;With the triumph of the Yugoslavist religion, [From.GetTitledName] has ordered that all of his subjects should convert, and give up their old faiths. No leeway is given in this matter - anyone who refuses to convert will be considered the enemy of the Crown.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.13;I will accept Yugoslavism.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_yugoslav.13;I will say the words, but I will keep my true faith in secret.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_yugoslav.13;Never!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEYUGO15;Order of St Tito;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCYUGO15;With the consolidation of the Yugoslavist faith, monastic orders have been formed for the defense and propagation of the religion. One of these is a group of pious knights who have joined together for the defense of Yugoslavism against its many enemies. They refuse to fight other Yugoslavists, and work tirelessly to defend the faithful from their many enemies.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_yugoslav.15;At last we have our own protectors.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

nobelian1Desc;The secrets of the ancients are many and deep. Plumbing their mystic depths is very difficult even for the most dedicated scholar. Yet, if I ever wish to be counted among the Laureates, I must delve nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTC_nobelian1;My mentor will aid me on the difficult path.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian2Desc;The men I sent out to search for a mentor have returned with a skilled scholar-mystic. They ask for a substantial sum of gold in exchange for serving me.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_nobelian2;A fair price.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_nobelian2;Ridiculous! Away with you!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian3Desc;My men have returned with a skilled scholar and mystic. They've agreed to serve me," but only on the condition that I ""promise to give them whatever they desire"," without exception"" at an unspecified future date.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,

EVTOPTB_nobelian3;Are you insane?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

nobelian7Desc;As the sacred steam fills your lungs, your head swims with otherworldly visions. But these do not reveal useful secrets, but horrifying and unsettling images.

EVTOPTA_nobelian7;Help Me!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian8Desc;As you prepare to enter the sacred sauna, your Mentor stops you. They've heard of several rare ingredients that can enhance the sacred steam such that it is far more likely to yield success, but it will cost money to find and gather these ingredients.
