Under the blessings of Heaven, she bloomed and reigned over the world. But the people grew proud, and Great Russia was shattered. But now, that era has come to an end.

palmarian.1.d;The Pope in Rome has called for a great Crusade, a massive armed struggle by the whole Catholic world against the infidels. Though you have been brought up to believe that the Roman Pope was a false pretender to the title, you start to wonder if the differences between your two faiths really matter in the face of the obviously greater threat of paganism and heresy plaguing the continent. Perhaps you should help these Crusaders? The Pope in Palmar won't like it, though?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

palmarian.2.d;While you've been riding with the train of knights in the Crusade, you've drawn the odd stares of many of the Crusaders.

palmarian.3.d;During your time on Crusade, you have come by necessity to have strong relationships with many of the knights, and have grown fond of several of them. Sometimes, they talk to you about religion, and you have to face the tough question of why the Palmarian Church even exists at all. Were the visions of one seer really sufficient grounds to split with Rome? And besides that, some of the people here have left everything behind, or at least lost vast sums of money, purely for the privelige of taking part in the Holy War.

EVTNAMEINVADERS1;Wars and Rumours of Wars;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS1;Troubling rumours have been coming west in recent years, speaking of two great empires in the far east which are finally gearing up to settle their centuries-long grievance with each other. The rumours speak of these two realms as 'China' and 'Sibera', and claim that the two have been constantly feuding for hundreds of years. Whatever the result of this war, it will likely result in complete destruction for the loser.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTNAMEINVADERS2;The Cold Wind of the East;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS2;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Chinese stand victorious. The Siberian Empire has been utterly crushed. Even now Chinese Governors establish military outposts in the snowy lands of Siberia, and tribute caravans laden with ivory and rare woods make their way to the Imperial City. While many Siberians remain in their homeland and acclimatise to foreign rule, a large group of the Siberian nobility, army, and peasants have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the wrath of China. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCINVADERS5;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Siberians stand victorious. The Great Empire of China has been shattered, and now a Siberian sits upon the Dragon Throne, having declared himself the founder of a new Dynasty and possessor of the Mandate of Heaven. As he prepares his armies for the decades-long task of pacifying the countryside and consolidating his rule, large sections of the defeated Chinese army, nobility and peasantry have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the chaos that is sure to result. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;x

parabrahmanist1Desc;Though there have always been warriors dedicated to fighting for the Bhagavanist faith, so far they have been isolated and scattered, unable to coordinate their efforts beyond their local areas. Now, a group of powerful rulers have come together to provide extensive financial support for an order of holy warriors dedicated to defending the Bhagavanist faith from all its enemies. These warriors have called themselves the Shiv Sena, and have sworn not to fight fellow followers of the religion of Bharat.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

parabrahmanist2Title;The Shiv Sena;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist2Desc;The Bhagavanist religion has always been combatative, dedicated to expelling heathens and adharma from the holy land of India. However, they have recently suffered many defeats and setbacks, which has greatly worried many of the faithful. [From.GetTitledName] has heard these worries, and has decreed the formation of a new order for the defense of India. This new holy order, the Shiv Sena, is to be a band of warriors devoted to the defense of the Bhagavanist religion, and is not to fight coreligionists under any circumstances. The Shiv Sena will surely be a prominent force in the religious wars of India from now on.;;;;;;;;;x,

parabrahmanist3Title;Rise of Bharat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist3Desc;For centuries, India has been splintered, and indeed can hardly be called a realm in any but the loosest possible sense. However, [From.GetTitledName] has reversed centuries of decline and turned it back, winning glorious battles and unifying all of India beneath one banner. Now, the great Empire of Bharat is unified once again, and the holy land of India is safe from foreign invaders.;;;;;;;;;x,,
,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist4Title;The Dharmayudda;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist4Desc;Though the Bhagavanist religion has always advocated for holy struggle to liberate India from foreign religion and wickedness, their efforts have hardly ever been united, and they have spent nearly as much time fighting each other as fighting heathens. The Mahapandit has declared that this has gone on too long. In a fiery speech given before a crowd of thousands, he has declared that all faithful Hindus should unite against the infidels, and strive together to reclaim the sacred land. This marks the beginning of a new era of Hindu holy wars - the Dharmayuddas.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

america1Title;The Redcoats Assemble;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1Desc;Everyone has heard the legends of the great British Empire, and of the glory that was hers long ago, before the world broke. But of all the lands of the Crown that were lost, the fabled "America" has always been foremost in the minds of the British. Myths tell of the expulsion of The Queen's forces from America by the demon Washington, and though Her Majesty's forces recovered from this defeat, they never reclaimed those far lands. With Imperial power waxing once more, the lords of Britannia have decided to prove themselves by doing what even their antediluvian ancestors could not - return to the land of America and conquer it. The Redcoats have been assembled, and given massive amounts of manpower and money to undertake this task, one they have happily accepted.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1A;It won't be long now until they're on their way;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1B;Those Anglos are up to something...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1C;This is our concern how?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america2Title;The Redcoats Embark;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america2Desc;Having spent the last year gathering soldiers and preparing ships and supplies, the Redcoats are finally ready to embark on their voyage to America. The first ships left port this morning, following ancient mariners' charts, and hope to report back within a few years.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america2A;We wish them a safe and speedy voyage;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america2B;May they drown on the way;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
america2C;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america3Title;Fall of The Newfindlers;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america3Desc;Word comes from the West! The Redcoats have landed in the place called 'Newfindland', it appears to be a large Island off the North East Coast of the Mainland. There, they have found but a squabbling bunch of barbarians, speaking strange dialects and worshipping stranger gods. They have subjugated them, and brought them back under the Crown's dominion. Though the Newfindlers fought back, resistance was less than expected. Perhaps the reconquest of America is not such a far-fetched dream after all?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america3A;Rule Britannia!
america3B;The Eternal Anglo strikes again;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america3C;This is not our business;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america3E;Excellent. Order them to focus on going South along the coastline;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america4Title;The Crawling Chaos;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4Desc;Word comes from the West! The Redcoats arrived in America several months ago, but to their great surprise, they discovered that the land of Newfindland was held by an enormous kingdom, stretching across onto the canadian mainland. The ruler of this realm, has rallied their warriors, and the Redcoat forces have been shattered. In disarray, they have been utterly wiped out.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4A;What a disaster!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4B;Ha! Serves them right!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4C;And the weather report?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america5Title;Reinforcements;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5Desc;The messengers who recently told us of the Redcoats' victories across the sea have also carried an appeal directly from the Lord-Admiral. It claims that, though their soldiers have fought bravely and victory was achieved, it was not achieved without substantial cost. America is obviously far more heavily populated than we had anticipated, and the Redcoats' arrival is sure to unite the troublesome colonials together in opposition to them. The Lord-Admiral therefore pleads for more supplies and soldiers to be sent to their new capital in Newfindland, warning that without reinforcements, future victory remains uncertain.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5A;They shall have it. Load the ships!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5B;They are just greedy cowards. What they have already is quite sufficient;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5C;You shouldn't tag over to e_redcoats, you know! This option is only for the AI, silly!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america6Title;The Burning of Boston;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america6Desc;The ancient city of Boston has finally been burned by the Brittonian invader forces. For at least 20 days has this city endured constant attacks and explosions made by the British army. The North End was affected the most and nearly all buildings turned to rubble in the matter of 2 days until the British broke the defences and pushed their forces even further reaching the final line of defense Roslindale Fort. The siege ended in 6 days and the native forces were forced to sign an act of surrender. It is a day of celebration for the Britons and today will be remembered as the day that America has been touched by European hands once again after 800 years of hiatus. The first reports say that the British officers are already celebrating their victory in one of the last remaining churches in Boston.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america6A;The ancient slight is avenged;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
thelemaresponse;Rule Britannia!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america7Title;A Disastrous Repeat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america7Desc;Even though everything seemed to turn out in favor of the British invader forces the battle that took place in Portland was a disaster. Surrounded by overwhelming forces of New Englanders the British Navy could do nothing but stay in their ships and watch as their own ships burn right before their eyes. Having been equiped with ships of superior power the British were forced to retreat to Peaks Island and as soon as the native's forces caught up to them the battle took place on land. It was a gruesome defeat with nobody surving being surrounded by vile warriors ready to kill anybody wearing red and food shortages that decimated that once great and majestic army. This failure serves as a reminder that one should not underestimate the New World's forces.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america7A;Give me back my legions!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
thelemaresponseBad;That...isn't good. At all;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america8Title;Victory in New York;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america8Desc;The offensive on an American soil has so far been successful especially when we consider what happened in New York. The troops were overwhelmingly superior to the American forces and this would show when breaching the Manhattan bridge the most heavily defended structure in New York's siege. This however wasn't enough to stop the well prepared and well fed British army who had no problem in obliterating the unprepared and shocked forces of New Yorkers. The battle later moved to Long Island and this is the place where an act of surrender was signed. Truly a victorious day for the British.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america18Desc;It is over. The Redcoats have utterly lost control of their holdings in America, and they have been scattered to the four winds. Their soldiers have surrendered, some being absorbed into the civilian populace, others attempting to flee back across the Ocean, very few of whom will ever be seen again. The few survivors tell harowing stories of American savagery and vengeance, hounded by the fear that the demons of the New World will not leave them be, but will pursue them back home...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america18A;They could never bring such a big force over the ocean! Right..?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america19Title;The Wind Comes From The West;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america19Desc;Some years ago, the Redcoat Dominion invaded the distant and fabled land of America. Their invasion ultimately failed, and little has been heard from that land ever since. But now, the worst fears of the Redcoat survivors have been realised - the Americans, galvanised by the shock of the British invasion, and realising that the world beyond the Atlantic is within range of colonisation, and having spent several years building a fleet of ships, have launched a great invasion of the Old World. Their armies have already landed near the Orkneys, in Ireland, and they have unfurled their banner, declaring their intent to establish American hegemony upon this world.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america19A;I've got a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Myths tell of the expulsion of The Queen's forces from America by the demon Washington, and though Her Majesty's forces recovered from this defeat, they never reclaimed those far lands. Recently, this ancient defeat has been much on the mind of the Grandmaster of the Redcoats, who has gathered a large number of soldiers and set off for the far distant land, hoping to conquer it for the Crown once more.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america21Desc;Several years ago, the Redcoat Dominion crossed the roaring Atlantic and invaded mysterious America. The last anyone heard of them was five years ago, by which point they had defeated almost all of the major realms of Eastern America. Despite this success, the British have been growing concerned - the Redcoats are meant to send annual reports back to the homeland to inform them about the progress of the invasion, but no such reports have been received for five years or so. What could have happened to them? None of the investigators that have set out from Britain have returned, and it may well be that we will never know what happened to them, unless and until they decide to tell us.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

At first the ballad is idiom-heavy, but you can understand that it speaks of some children, playing war and chivalric battles among themselves, without understanding its full implementations, with the point-of-view voice speaking as one of those children, condemning themselves for their misdeeds. Ballad then presumably mentions a deity called Voronyo, a giant murder of crows, who followed the children anywhere they would go. Then suddenly the voice starts talking to the audience directly and warns you not to repeat their mistakes. You start thinking the Ballad may have something to do with the Deluge...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAMECOURTE.6924;Ballad about a Deer.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCCOURTE.6924;You start hearing jumpy, though tragic Gitara music. You hardly understand what song is about in essence because of a language barrier, but you are somehow managing to grab individual phrases. Song is speaking of the Deer, a primordial deity of some kind. Deer is depicted running through the empty city, bringing the people to the other world, where both existing and not existing live. The Point-of-View character longs for the deer, whishes him to come back and take him to that world. You are not sure about the true meaning of this Ballad.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAMECOURTE.6925;Ballad about Time.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCCOURTE.6925;Bard takes his Gitara and starts to play melodic and slow lyrics-heavy ballad. At first you cant fully grasp the sense of the piece, but you understand certain phrases and idioms. You hear of a long-abandoned castle, speaking up about jousts, sieges and archery that happened in the time long past. It speaks of steel, shattering from the sword impact, bowstring, smoking from tension and The Death itself, sitting on the armies' spears. About True Love and High Treason. The Main character of the song asks you of perpetual validity of such concepts as Love, Evil and Good. The ballad then sings about the time itself, and how even in a days old gone there where always some constant, unchanging concepts. You are staring to thing this ballad might be a moral testament of pre-deluge Rodina...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

nistr1title;The Rump Empire;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
nistr1desc;Among the empires of Europe Transnistria is one of the only among them which can trace it's origins to before the event. It had taken many forms throughout the years, first a tribe under the legendary Smirnovescu chiefs. Then, after a brief period of foreign rule, the nistrenian people revolted and established a stratocratic republic, with revolting army's generals becoming the new rulers of the realm. The Nistrenian Republic grew far and wide, eventually encompassing the whole kingdom of moldavia. Though the stratocracy was eventually replaced by the Transnistrian Empire under the Saint Empress Andriana, the State still remained, growing in Size to eventually incorporate most of the lands from Danube and Carpathians on the west to Volga and Caucasus to the east. Everything changed when Imparatul Octavian of the Portucaliu dynasty died without leaving a heir. The resultant crisis took a heavy toll on the Empire. Destabilized and reduced thrice in size, with the Korol of Ukraine growing greater in strength. The Empire is now on the verge of complete dissolution, the Dragos Imparatuls sitting on the throne must ensure the reformation of the mere rump state into the proper Empire it once was.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

This, in turn, had left to Imparatul's powers dropping extensively, eventually leading to them abandoning him altogether and de-facto dissolvent of the empire.  ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

nistr100title;Sche ne vmerla Ukraïna!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
nistr100desc;Ukraine as a post-deluge kingdom had a bumpy history. Originally united in 2210 by Borys Stovbur, a chief from the city of Poltava, it later grew in size immensely, conquering not only all of the Ukrainian, but the Belarusian land as well. On Ukraïna's territorial peak Tsisar Bohdan even formed an Empire- Tsisarstvo of the Grand Ruthenia. Shamefully, the Empire didn't last for long, as Bohdan was killed be Imparataesa Andriana of the growing Transnistrian Empire. Bohdans realm was split between his two sons, Roman ruling in Belarus and Panas in Ukraine. Eventually Panas swear loyalty to the Imparateasa, to keep Ukraine from complete collapse. This was a crucial decision, as the Kingdom of Ukraine later became a major part of the Empire's history, strongly influencing its politics and even partaking in major civil wars. Nowadays, at the end of the rescent succession crisis, Ukraine came up at the top, as Korol Hryhoriy Kobzar had united with Patriarch Carol to stop the turmoil, instlling Patriarch's son, Ieremia as the ne Imparatul, a figurhead for the two. Would Ukraïna come up on top of this alliance, or will it finally be dissolved in the Transnistrian Empire?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Though Korol of Ukraine could not not share their sentiments, his status as a representative figure for the ukrainers informaly forbids him from becoming the Imparatul.

nistr102title;Empire ruined by an Emperor.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
nistr102desc;From the inception of the Transnistrian empire Ukrainers and Moldovans have been at each-other's throats, as Transnistria had defeated Grand Ruthenia and shattered it, vassalizing Ukraine. Recently though a major piece of news had reached our realm. Korol of Ukraine, after becoming the Imparatul had decided to completely shatter the Transnistrian Empire! The nobles of the realm couldn't have done much, as the vile Imparatul had a total control over the military, ordering to murder most of them at sight. Korol now bravely gazes into the future, as Transnistria is now becoming a mere thing of the past.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

nistr104title;Ecumenical Patriarch takes over!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
nistr104desc;After the Transnistrian Empire collapsed, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, historically subservient to the empire, felt a lack of authority. The Patriarchate needed to take ecclesiastical orders from a secular ruler, but without an emperor there is no-one giving orders. That's why The Ecumenical Patriarch decided to declare full independence, by usurping the heartlands of what once was The Empire of Transnistria. Most other Patriarchs, including the Georgian and Ukrainian, have accepted this. With the central authority of Orthodoxites now independent, their autonomy would surely increase.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
