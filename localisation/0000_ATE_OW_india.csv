old_hindu_DESC;Hinduism is a blanket term for a variety of related traditions and practices found in the Indian subcontinent, with a history going back millenia before the event. Post-event hindus worship various dieties, or 'Devas' out of which Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, and Shakti used to be prominent, but local and minor gods have increased in importance over time, and the goddess Lakshmi has seen an especial increase in importance. Gandhi began to be revered as a god, while worship of Brahma was dropped altogether. Adherents of the faith hold that the event was caused by the god Kalki, an incarnation of Vishnu, who destroyed the world because of its impious and decadent ways. The religion is based on a collection of religious scriptures known as a Vedas, as well as various other post-vedic texts and a few post-event ones. They also believe that they reincarnate after death. A prominent aspect of the religion is adherence to the varna system, where society is divided into four castes: The Brahmins (Priests), Kshatriyas (Rulers), Vaishyas (Skilled Laborers), and Shudras (Unskilled Laborers).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
neovedic;Neovedic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
neovedic;Neovedic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
neovedic_DESC;A mysterious faith still not completely documented or understood by scholars of the subcontinent. Among other things, neovedics believe that several aeons ago, the evil lord of the Danavas, Vritra, was slain by Indra. Vritra's brother, Allah, swore revenge on all the gods, and sent four Danavas, one by one, to destroy the earth which they held so dear. The first three were successfully killed by the devas, but over time, the inhabitants of the world began to forget the devas and their rituals, and began to worship false gods. Thus, in order to punish them, when the last Danava Kalki attacked, the gods watched the world burn, and did nothing to save it. To rectify humanity's great error, the Neovedic faithful worship the old gods and perform rituals outlined in the Fifth Veda, a collection of religious texts believed to be revealed by the gods themselves. Adherents of the faith show no hesitation in raiding or even invading realms of heathen rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
naxalite;Maunaxite;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naxalite_DESC;Formed from a blend of Indian tribal religion and a foreign creed imported to the subcontinent before the Event, the Maunaxites have always been an insular and beleaguered group, used to withstanding contempt and attacks from outsiders. The faith chiefly reveres Maushiva, the Red King, who inevitably rises up to destroy corrupt rulers and raise the poor and oppressed. Other deities worshipped include Vishnu, Mao, and, of course, as in every other part of India, the omnipresent Cult of Gandhi, the great Avatar of Vishnu.;;;;;;;;x,,,;
naxalite_reformed;Maunaxite;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naxalite_reformed_DESC;Formed from a blend of Indian tribal religion and a foreign creed imported to the subcontinent before the Event, the Maunaxites have always been an insular and beleaguered group, used to withstanding contempt and attacks from outsiders. The faith chiefly reveres Maushiva, the Red King, who inevitably rises up to destroy corrupt rulers and raise the poor and oppressed. The faith has now been reformed, adding a priestly hierarchy and formalised texts, enabling it to more effectively resist the encroachment of other faiths.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;
neovedantic;Neo-Vedantic;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neovedantic_DESC;Neo-Vedanticism is a hindu school of thought that advocates for the rejection of the varna system and abhors discrimination on the basis of social class. They consider themselves the successors of a pre-event movement, while other dharmics think they emerged some time after the event. The word 'Neo-Vedantic' was originally used by their opponents to disparage them, with the implication that they represented a break from tradition and hence were not authentically hindu. Neovedantics also differ in another crucial aspect: They consider Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva as the three most important deities of hinduism (The Trimurti), while other devas are relegated to a more minor role. Kubera, the god of wealth, has been elevated in status by neovedantics, and is widely worshipped by many of them. Furthermore, Neovedantic rulers believe that non-dharmic religions should be tolerated by hindus, and are therefore known to view the Bharatva in a poor light.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bharatva;Bharatva;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bharatva_DESC;The Bharatva religion came to dominate many parts of India in the chaos following the Event. It is a highly dogmatic religion born out of hinduism, focused on the belief that India, or 'Bharat', is a holy land belonging only to the Indians, and that traditional Hindu beliefs and practices are essential to being a 'true' Indian. Like pre-event hindus, they venerate various gods, but they view all gods as aspects of one, the Para Brahman. The bharatva deify what they believe to be great indian rulers of the ancient past, such as the legendary King Bharata and Gandhi. They believe that at various points in history, the Asura (Demonic) god Allah sent many Asura kings and their armies to destroy India, such as Ghazni, Mughal, and Angrezi. Each of them was stopped by various legendary hindu rulers, except for the final Asura king, Kalki, who almost managed to destroy the subcontinent, and plunged it into an age of darkness. They call for the unification of all Indians under the aegis of a Bharatva ruler and seek to establish a Vedic society, to protect Bharat from being annihilated by the next Asura. Their resulting antagonism toward non-Dharmic religions results in them being among the most aggressive religions in their part of the world.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC_laskandar_restoration;In the grand scheme of things, the Mumbaikar dynasty were nothing. A lowly patrician dynasty from Mumbai, they claimed descent from Ioannes Karasci, the so-called "Father of the Yunani", but of course, nobody believed them. But when little Lashkandra was born, the dynasty would forever be etched into the history books in bold letters. His early life was shrouded in mystery, but when he brought down the mighty kingdom of Rajasthan with a heavily outnumbered army, the eyes of the entire subcontinent were on him. Gujarat, Sindh, Ajmer, kingdoms fell to his armies like dominoes. When he died, however, it all seemed pointless, as his son Laskandar was clearly too young to rule, and the realm of the great conqueror shattered like glass. But now....now, it is clear that Lashkandra still lives in the blood of his descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

After him, various kings would come and go, without managing to establish stable rule for their dynasty. Nothing lasts forever, and under a tyrant king, the realm collapsed into squabbling states. Isaakiya, a minor ruler belonging to the Yukonama family, managed to re-unify Yunakshetra and end the era of anarchy, establishing the longest reigning yunani dynasty in history. Nothing lasts forever, so the Yukonama dynasty fell to another pagan invasion, leaving only a bastard son who fled to Gujarat. However, his line has now managed to re-unite Yunakshetra, proving to the world that the light of Yunakshetra still shines bright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

TITLE_mumbai_triumphant;Mumbai, Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC_mumbai_triumphant;Ever since Yunakshetra was conquered by Yunaneshwar Desai, Mumbai has remained the final bastion of the Yunani. The nobles that still remained after the war with the pagan king fled to the city, and elected a new ruler to be their protector against further incursions. Partly due to its location in the middle of a major trade route, the ruling class soon turned to more mercantile pursuits, and Mumbai grew rich. Of course, the newly crowned Desai king, son of the conquering Yunaneshwar and a victor in a brief civil war, thought that this wealth would be better off in his hands. The protector of Mumbai was out of options, so he negotiated an annual tribute to the King in return for leaving them alone. But now, everything has changed. Mumbai has come to rule the erstwhile lands of Yunakshetra, and it can finally claim to be a worthy successor to the Yunani kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
