DESC_renovatio_0001;The imperial citizens of old were seemingly very far removed from the imperial citizens of today. It is said that the whole empire spoke in one tongue. That they wore exotic garments beyond the wildest dreams of even the Kings of today. Our finest scholars have reconstructed their language, and learned whatever they could of their traditions from the documents and relics that survive the empire's demise. To claim legitimacy and assert our authority, we could adopt the culture of the ancient people. It will be inconvenient to drastically change the traditions of the entirety of the empire,
