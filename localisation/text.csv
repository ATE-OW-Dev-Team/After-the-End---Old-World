novelist_DESC;Novelists were gatherers of knowledge of old. Ancient and mystics tomes holding depiction and exploits of past gods and heroes were reunited into one holy book, the Novel, telling the story of what really happened before the Fall. Some call it 'fiction', but Novelists firmly believe that they are precise and accurate transcriptions of the past, narrating stories of heroes worthy of worship, upon which one should seek the same fate.;Title;Title;;Title;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
nobelian_DESC;Since the Fall, Nobelians worshipped an old, wise, bearded god who helped mankind to achieve marvels in science, literature and peace, sending holy men and saints on Earth to guide humanity to greatness. The numerous medals with the face of God on them proved he was largely worshipped in the old world, and if Laureates are nowadays rarer than before, faith can be put in Nobel to lead, once again, mankind on the path to glory.;Title;Title;;Title;;;;;;;;;x

prussianist_DESC;Prussianism is a heretical branch that grew out of the Lutheran church in east Germany. The Church retains many Christian doctrines,but have added extra doctrines out of step with mainstream Protestantism (and Christianity more generally). They believe that,in addition to the Prophets of old,God later sent a prophet to the Germans,known as 'The Kaiser'. They believe that the Kaiser saved the German people from the assualt of the heretical Pope,who had seceded from the true Church for political reasons. In-game,the Prussianists are far more militant and aggressive than mainstream Lutherans,believing in the importance of martial skill and valor.;;;;;;;;;x,,
