EVTDESC_ATEOW_realm_event_99999;Legends say that at one time all Slavs where united as brothers, but the great disaster that befell our world tore us apart. Yugoslavia showed that hope of reunification was not lost, and like the Southern Slavs it was only a matter of time until the Western Slavs would find common ground and reunite.\n\nIt was [e_zapadoslavia.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick] who finally brought the Western Slavs together under the banner of Zapadoslavia. Throughout the new realm, Poles, Czechs and Slovaks celebrate this momentous occasion.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

EVTTITLE_ATEOW_realm_event_99998;Rise of the British Raj;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC_ATEOW_realm_event_99998;Legend tells that, in the distant past, all of India was conquered by the Queen, who personally slew the Hindoo deity Rama when he tried to stop Her. [e_british_india.Holder.GetTitledName] has re-established British rule over India, having seized control of the cities listed in the ancient records as the centers of the subcontinent. A lavish coronation has been organised, and while the British Raj may not yet extend over the whole of India, the foundations for its conquest have been laid.;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTOPTA_ATEOW_realm_event_99998;The Queen is better able to rule us than our own 'leaders'.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

form_romaraj_desc;It is said that a long time ago all Romani people were all united under a King of All Gypsies. Perhaps a powerful enough Romani leader can claim that title for himself again.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

palmarian.1.d;The Pope in Rome has called for a great Crusade, a massive armed struggle by the whole Catholic world against the infidels. Though you have been brought up to believe that the Roman Pope was a false pretender to the title, you start to wonder if the differences between your two faiths really matter in the face of the obviously greater threat of paganism and heresy plaguing the continent. Perhaps you should help these Crusaders? The Pope in Palmar won't like it, though…;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.1;I will help my Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.1;Let the schismatics fight their own wars;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
palmarian.2.d;While you've been riding with the train of knights in the Crusade, you've drawn the odd stares of many of the Crusaders. Clearly your Hispanic complexion and accent have drawn their suspicion. Eventually, a burly, heavyset Italian confronts you and asks what a Palmarian is doing in the train of the warriors of God. The crowd is getting restless, and it seems that they'll demand your expulsion soon...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.2;Beg them to let you stay;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.2;Prove your worth to them with a show of martial skill;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTE_palmarian.2;Storm off and leave the Crusade altogether;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
palmarian.3.d;During your time on Crusade, you have come by necessity to have strong relationships with many of the knights, and have grown fond of several of them. Sometimes, they talk to you about religion, and you have to face the tough question of why the Palmarian Church even exists at all. Were the visions of one seer really sufficient grounds to split with Rome? And besides that, some of the people here have left everything behind, or at least lost vast sums of money, purely for the privelige of taking part in the Holy War. Certainly you rarely saw this kind of ardor in Spain. Could it be that the Roman Church trul yis the real Catholic Church after all?;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.3;God has revealed the truth to me!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.3;I believe - but I cannot admit it, I would lose my status.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

palmarian.4.d;You have received an angry letter from your local bishop back in Spain. In it, he curses you for running off to aid the schismatic Church and warns you that you are playing dangerous games with your soul if you continue to struggle in the service of the False Faith. He urges you to return to Spain immediately.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.4;Tell him bluntly to shut up;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.4;Set off for home immediately - I'm jeopardising my standing too much;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_palmarian.4;Lie and convince him that you are not actually on Crusade, just out of the Kingdom for other reasons;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_palmarian.4;Provide him with a theological rationale for why your actions are justifiable;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
palmarian.5.d;To your surprise,your group has discovered a small family of Palmarians living in an isolated village near the Crusade target. The more vulgar members of your troop, eager to sate their appetite for cruelty, have smashed up much of their property and taunted them for being schismatics. Your heart burns to see such shameful behavior between Christians - aren't we supposed to be fighting the same enemy? But the others will be angry if you interrupt their 'fun'...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.5;Recompense the family for their loss;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.5;There's nothing I can do;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_palmarian.5;Looks like fun! Let me join!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_palmarian.5;We're here to fight FOR Christians, not against them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_palmarian.5;Reprimand them publically for their cruelty;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
palmarian.6.d;A brave soldier has distinguished himself during the Crusade, and has presented himself to you. He claims to be from a relatively poor family and, seeing that you come from a noble house, thinks it'd be better to join you and serve at your court when the Crusade is over.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.6;There's no such thing as too many good men!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
palmarian.7.d;You have taken part in an assault that captured an important fortification! You have been showered in glory, and the knights are all hailing you as a true crusader!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
palmarian.8.d;With the end of the Crusade, the bands of knights depart. You have no choice but to return home.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTNAMEINVADERS1;Wars and Rumours of Wars;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS1;Troubling rumours have been coming west in recent years, speaking of two great empires in the far east which are finally gearing up to settle their centuries-long grievance with each other. The rumours speak of these two realms as 'China' and 'Sibera', and claim that the two have been constantly feuding for hundreds of years. Whatever the result of this war, it will likely result in complete destruction for the loser.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_INVADERS1;No concern of ours.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEINVADERS2;The Cold Wind of the East;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS2;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Chinese stand victorious. The Siberian Empire has been utterly crushed. Even now Chinese Governors establish military outposts in the snowy lands of Siberia, and tribute caravans laden with ivory and rare woods make their way to the Imperial City. While many Siberians remain in their homeland and acclimatise to foreign rule, a large group of the Siberian nobility, army, and peasants have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the wrath of China. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_INVADERS2;And these are the ones who *lost* the war?!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEINVADERS5;Wings of the Dragon;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS5;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Siberians stand victorious. The Great Empire of China has been shattered, and now a Siberian sits upon the Dragon Throne, having declared himself the founder of a new Dynasty and possessor of the Mandate of Heaven. As he prepares his armies for the decades-long task of pacifying the countryside and consolidating his rule, large sections of the defeated Chinese army, nobility and peasantry have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the chaos that is sure to result. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEINVADERS6;Massive Settlement;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS6;Having established a new ream for themselves in the West, [Root.GetTitledName] has decided to settle many of those who fled in their new lands. Already a wide-scale building campaign is working to provide housing and settlements for the newcomers to live in, fuelled primarily by grants of land taken from the natives.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_INVADERS6;Excellent;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_INVADERS6;Interesting;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS7;Large swathes of our migrating population has decided to settle down in [Root.GetName], massively expanding its infrastructure as well as displacing the rebellious native population.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

bharatva1Desc;Though there have always been warriors dedicated to fighting for the Bharatva faith, so far they have been isolated and scattered, unable to coordinate their efforts beyond their local areas. Now, a group of powerful rulers have come together to provide extensive financial support for an order of holy warriors dedicated to defending the Bhartva faith from all its enemies. These warriors have called themselves the Shiv Sena, and have sworn not to fight fellow followers of the religion of Bharat.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
bharatva1Title;The Shiv Sena;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_bharatva1;Jai Hind!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_bharatva1;Those antiquarian murderers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_bharatva1;May Allah destroy those violent heathens!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_bharatva1;The Bharatvists are organising? That could be dangerous...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_bharatva1;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
bharatva2Title;The Shiv Sena;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bharatva2Desc;The Bharatva religion has always been combatative, dedicated to expelling heathens and adharma from the holy land of India. However, they have recently suffered many defeats and setbacks, which has greatly worried many of the faithful. [From.GetTitledName] has heard these worries, and has decreed the formation of a new order for the defense of India. This new holy order, the Shiv Sena, is to be a band of warriors devoted to the defense of the Bharatva religion, and is not to fight coreligionists under any circumstances. The Shiv Sena will surely be a prominent force in the religious wars of India from now on.;;;;;;;;;x,
,,,,,,,,
bharatva3Title;Rise of Bharat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bharatva3Desc;For centuries, India has been splintered, and indeed can hardly be called a realm in any but the loosest possible sense. However, [From.GetTitledName] has reversed centuries of decline and turned it back, winning glorious battles and unifying all of India beneath one banner. Now, the great Empire of Bharat is unified once again, and the holy land of India is safe from foreign invaders.;;;;;;;;;x,,
,,,,,,,,
bharatva4Title;The Dharmayudda;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bharatva4Desc;Though the Bharatva religion has always advocated for holy struggle to liberate India from foreign religion and wickedness, their efforts have hardly ever been united, and they have spent nearly as much time fighting each other as fighting heathens. The Mahapandit has declared that this has gone on too long. In a fiery speech given before a crowd of thousands, he has declared that all faithful Hindus should unite against the infidels, and strive together to reclaim the sacred land. This marks the beginning of a new era of Hindu holy wars - the Dharmayuddas.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
