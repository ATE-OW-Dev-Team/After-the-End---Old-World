EVTDESC_ATEOW_realm_event_99999;Legends say that at one time all Slavs where united as brothers, but the great disaster that befell our world tore us apart.

EVTDESC_ATEOW_realm_event_99998;Legend tells that, in the distant past, all of India was conquered by the Queen, who personally slew the Hindoo deity Rama when he tried to stop Her. [e_british_india.Holder.GetTitledName] has re-established British rule over India, having seized control of the cities listed in the ancient records as the centers of the subcontinent.

palmarian.1.d;The Pope in Rome has called for a great Crusade, a massive armed struggle by the whole Catholic world against the infidels. Though you have been brought up to believe that the Roman Pope was a false pretender to the title, you start to wonder if the differences between your two faiths really matter in the face of the obviously greater threat of paganism and heresy plaguing the continent. Perhaps you should help these Crusaders? The Pope in Palmar won't like it, though�;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

palmarian.2.d;While you've been riding with the train of knights in the Crusade, you've drawn the odd stares of many of the Crusaders.

palmarian.3.d;During your time on Crusade, you have come by necessity to have strong relationships with many of the knights, and have grown fond of several of them. Sometimes, they talk to you about religion, and you have to face the tough question of why the Palmarian Church even exists at all. Were the visions of one seer really sufficient grounds to split with Rome? And besides that, some of the people here have left everything behind, or at least lost vast sums of money, purely for the privelige of taking part in the Holy War.

EVTNAMEINVADERS1;Wars and Rumours of Wars;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS1;Troubling rumours have been coming west in recent years, speaking of two great empires in the far east which are finally gearing up to settle their centuries-long grievance with each other. The rumours speak of these two realms as 'China' and 'Sibera', and claim that the two have been constantly feuding for hundreds of years. Whatever the result of this war, it will likely result in complete destruction for the loser.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_INVADERS1;No concern of ours.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAMEINVADERS2;The Cold Wind of the East;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCINVADERS2;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Chinese stand victorious. The Siberian Empire has been utterly crushed. Even now Chinese Governors establish military outposts in the snowy lands of Siberia, and tribute caravans laden with ivory and rare woods make their way to the Imperial City. While many Siberians remain in their homeland and acclimatise to foreign rule, a large group of the Siberian nobility, army, and peasants have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the wrath of China. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCINVADERS5;It seems that the Great War in the East is finally over, and the Siberians stand victorious. The Great Empire of China has been shattered, and now a Siberian sits upon the Dragon Throne, having declared himself the founder of a new Dynasty and possessor of the Mandate of Heaven. As he prepares his armies for the decades-long task of pacifying the countryside and consolidating his rule, large sections of the defeated Chinese army, nobility and peasantry have chosen to migrate to the West to escape the chaos that is sure to result. Though reduced in size since their defeat, this force is still very large, with a hard core of professional soldiers reinforced by refugees and desperate men trying to find new lives for themselves and their families. Though only a remnant of its former greatness, this Empire-in-Exile could easily prove a grave threat to its neighbors.;;;;;;;;;x

bharatva1Desc;Though there have always been warriors dedicated to fighting for the Bharatva faith, so far they have been isolated and scattered, unable to coordinate their efforts beyond their local areas. Now, a group of powerful rulers have come together to provide extensive financial support for an order of holy warriors dedicated to defending the Bhartva faith from all its enemies. These warriors have called themselves the Shiv Sena, and have sworn not to fight fellow followers of the religion of Bharat.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
bharatva1Title;The Shiv Sena;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

bharatva2Title;The Shiv Sena;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bharatva2Desc;The Bharatva religion has always been combatative, dedicated to expelling heathens and adharma from the holy land of India. However, they have recently suffered many defeats and setbacks, which has greatly worried many of the faithful. [From.GetTitledName] has heard these worries, and has decreed the formation of a new order for the defense of India. This new holy order, the Shiv Sena, is to be a band of warriors devoted to the defense of the Bharatva religion, and is not to fight coreligionists under any circumstances. The Shiv Sena will surely be a prominent force in the religious wars of India from now on.;;;;;;;;;x,
,,,,,,,,
bharatva3Title;Rise of Bharat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bharatva3Desc;For centuries, India has been splintered, and indeed can hardly be called a realm in any but the loosest possible sense. However, [From.GetTitledName] has reversed centuries of decline and turned it back, winning glorious battles and unifying all of India beneath one banner. Now, the great Empire of Bharat is unified once again, and the holy land of India is safe from foreign invaders.;;;;;;;;;x,,
,,,,,,,,
bharatva4Title;The Dharmayudda;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bharatva4Desc;Though the Bharatva religion has always advocated for holy struggle to liberate India from foreign religion and wickedness, their efforts have hardly ever been united, and they have spent nearly as much time fighting each other as fighting heathens. The Mahapandit has declared that this has gone on too long. In a fiery speech given before a crowd of thousands, he has declared that all faithful Hindus should unite against the infidels, and strive together to reclaim the sacred land. This marks the beginning of a new era of Hindu holy wars - the Dharmayuddas.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

america1Title;The Redcoats Assemble;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1Desc;Everyone has heard the legends of the great British Empire, and of the glory that was hers long ago, before the world broke. But of all the lands of the Crown that were lost, the fabled "America" has always been foremost in the minds of the British. Myths tell of the expulsion of The Queen's forces from America by the demon Washington, and though Her Majesty's forces recovered from this defeat, they never reclaimed those far lands. With Imperial power waxing once more, the lords of Britannia have decided to prove themselves by doing what even their antediluvian ancestors could not - search for the land of America, and if it still exists, conquer it. The Redcoats have been assembled, and given massive amounts of manpower and money to undertake this task, one they have happily accepted.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1A;It won't be long now until they're on their way;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1B;Those Anglos are up to something...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america1C;This is our concern how?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america2Title;The Redcoats Embark;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america2Desc;Having spent the last year gathering soldiers and preparing ships and supplies, the Redcoats are finally ready to embark on their voyage to America. The first ships left port this morning, following ancient mariners' charts, and hope to report back within a few years.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america2A;We wish them a safe and speedy voyage;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america2B;May they drown on the way;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
america2C;Who?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america3Title;Fall of The Yankees;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america3Desc;Word comes from the West! The Redcoats have landed in the place called 'New England', its name a clear sign that it was the heart of the old America. There, they have found but a squabbling bunch of barbarians, speaking strange dialects and worshipping stranger gods. They have subjugated them, and brought them back under the Crown's dominion. Though the Yan-Kees fought back, resistance was less than expected. Perhaps the reconquest of America is not such a far-fetched dream after all?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america3A;Rule Britannia!
america3B;The Eternal Anglo strikes again;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america3C;This is not our business;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america3E;Excellent. Order them to focus on retaking the Thirteen Colonies;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america4Title;The Crawling Chaos;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4Desc;Word comes from the West! The Redcoats arrived in America several months ago, but to their great surprise, they discovered that the holy land of New England was held by an enormous kingdom, stretching for hundreds of miles in every direction. The ruler of this realm, worshipped as gods by their subjects, have rallied their warriors, and the Redcoat forces have been shattered. In disarray, they have been utterly wiped out.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4A;What a disaster!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4B;Ha! Serves them right!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america4C;And the weather report?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america5Title;Reinforcements;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5Desc;The messengers who recently told us of the Redcoats' victories across the sea have also carried an appeal directly from the Lord-Admiral. It claims that, though their soldiers have fought bravely and victory was achieved, it was not achieved without substantial cost. America is obviously far more heavily populated than we had anticipated, and the Redcoats' arrival is sure to unite the troublesome colonials together in opposition to them. The Lord-Admiral therefore pleads for more supplies and soldiers to be sent to their new capital in Boston, warning that without reinforcements, future victory remains uncertain.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5A;They shall have it. Load the ships!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5B;They are just greedy cowards. What they have already is quite sufficient;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america5C;You shouldn't tag over to e_redcoats, you know! This option is only for the AI, silly!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america6Title;The Burning of Washington;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america6Desc;In the months since the conquest of New England, Redcoat scouts have had extensive contact with the strange statue-worshippers known as "Americanists". Fighting between these small kingdoms and the Redcoats has been particularly fierce, as both sides regard each other as not merely enemies, but devils in the flesh of men, and the fighting has been reported as shockingly brutal, with no quarter given on either side. Reports indicate that the fighting finally subsided about two months ago, with Redcoat forces occupying the city of Washington, razing many buildings and burning the Sacred Capitol of the Americans. The city has since been renamed to Queenstown, while the Redcoats prepare for their next attack.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america6A;The ancient slight is avenged;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
thelemaresponse;Rule Britannia!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america7Title;A Disastrous Repeat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america7Desc;News comes from the West! A bedraggled messenger arrived in London recently, his ship nearly in tatters and his crew all dead. What he had to say chilled the British to the bone. Apparently, the Redcoats had discovered that the worshippers of Washington still lived in America, and had made war upon them, but by some devilish magic had been defeated! His report was scattered and unclear, he seemed unsure whether to blame the Lord-Admiral's incompetence, the rebellious colonials, American sorcery, or all three. What we do know is that the Redcoat army was ambushed crossing the Delmarva River by someone only referred to as "President Armstrong" - presumably the American leader. Whatever the case, the Redcoats have been destroyed, and will not be returning.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america7A;Give me back my legions!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
thelemaresponseBad;That...isn't good. At all;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america8Title;O'er the Hills and Far Away;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america8Desc;After conquering the Americanists, the Redcoats have turned their attention to the mountainous region known as the Appalachians. The area is notoriously difficult to traverse, and rumour has it that the tribes of the region were forming a great Confederation to oppose Britain. However, the Lord-Admiral's forces managed to kill the leaders of several prominent tribes in a pivotal battle, ultimately causing the dissolution of the Confederation. Victory in the region is now inevitable, though it may take years to finally subjugate every isolated mountain hold and tribe.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america8A;Remind me to build some proper roads in that country when this is over.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america9Title;Lost and Confused;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america9Desc;After burning Washington, the Redcoats turned their attention to the mountainous Appalachians. Word had spread that a Confederation of Tribes was forming among these mountains to oppose the Redcoats, and their army was sent forth to crush it before it could form fully. Apparently, something has gone terribly wrong, and it seems that the Appalachians were able to wear down and destroy the Redcoats in those damnable mountains. The last communication anyone received warned that subjugated Americans were rebelling all over the East Coast, while Appalachian warriors surged down from the Hills...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america9A;Are we sure these men aren't Scottish?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america10Title;Marching Through Georgia;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america10Desc;The Redcoats have reported their most convincing victory yet, against a huge empire calling itself the "Holy Columbian Confederacy". These ridiculous people pride themselves on their heavy cavalry, and the Lord-Admiral's letter admits that their serried ranks of knights were an intimidating opponent, but his Handgoners were able to dramatically reduce the effectiveness of their heavy armor. In a series of devastating pitched battles, the Confederate forces were defeated, and the Southrons have been forced to capitulate. The Lord-Admiral has marched through Atlanta, reportedly receiving the crown of the HCC from the Emperor himself. With this victory, the British have subjugated nearly all the major realms in Eastern America, and can rightly consider themselves Lords of America.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america10A;A Triumph! America is ours once more;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america11Title;Spears of the South;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america11Desc;Shortly after the conquest of Appalachia, the forces of the Redcoats were met by an ambassador from the "Holy Columbian Confederacy". Before the Lord-Admiral had a chance to replenish his forces, hordes of Southron knights charged northwards, embarking on a lightning campaign that destroyed the Redcoats' tentative control over the American East Coast. With their military destroyed, the Americans revolted against British rule, with the Southrons assuming de facto leadership over the subjugated regions. Armies of knights dissuaded anyone who desired independence from both realms, and now the Emperor has achieved his long-sought-after goal of becoming ruler of all the heartland of Old America.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america11A;What? No! This can't be happening!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america12Title;Hudson Bay Retaken;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america12Desc;The Redcoats have marched north from New England, into the cold expanses of Canada. Their first target has been the Hudson River region, for its bountiful farmlands and crucial position as a shipping lane. Surviving British records say little about the people of this region. Seeing the presence of churches in the region, they presumed them to be Christians, but quite unlike most Christians they proved warlike in the extreme, haranguing the invaders wiht brutal and swift raids. Despite this, the Redcoat armies were able to subjugate their cities and force them to capitulate.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america12A;It seems a lot has changed while we were away;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america13Title;Hudsonia The Free;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america13Desc;News comes from the West! The Redcoats, having subjugated New England, had turned their attention to the Northern regions of America, hoping to take the Hudson River region. However, this region was controlled by a single great realm - the Hudsonian Empire, whose people are famous throughout the continent for their savagery. Harrassed at every angle by raiding parties, the British armies were eventually worn down and destroyed, before the victorious Hudsonians overran New England. Who knows what they may be planning now...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america13A;I never thought Canadians could be so fierce!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america14Title;Ontario Retaken;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america14Desc;After their conquest of the Hudson, the Redcoats moved on toward the largest city of Old Canada - Ontario. To their surprise and some dismay, they discovered that the Church of England, that antiquarian Christian church highly deplored in seminal Thelemic literature, still held sway in this remote part of the world. The Queen's faithful soldiers took great pleasure in overrunning the Canadian cities and destroying their Cathedrals.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america14A;Though you could escape over the sea? Ha!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america15Title;I Vow To Thee, My Country;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america15Desc;After taking the Hudson Region, the Redcoats turned to Ontario, confident of their victory. What they did not know, however, was that a trap had been laid for them. The great Kingdom of Ontario has in recent decades succeeded in unifying much of the lands of old Canada and the Great Lakes region, and was watching the Redcoats' invasion with grave concern. Following deliberately-planted false information, the Redcoat General led his forces into an ambush, where the combined armies of the Canadians managed to surround and rout them. With the loss of their army, the Redcoats' grip on America is slipping, as rebellions break out across the continent...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america15A;Those damned Canadians!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america16Title;The Dissolution of the Nunneries;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america16Desc;After the fall of Ontario, only one major obstacle remained to the Redcoats' conquest of Canada - old Qu�bec, that land famous in myth and legend for its stubbornness. Legend has it that the French had owned that land long ago, and as the Frenchman had ever opposed the Queen's light, so the Quebecois resisted her ten times harder. Indeed, they must be French, for no man but a Frenchman would be mad enough to be ruled by mortal women, as these ones apparently do. Though their supply lines were stretched and their forces spread thin by the long campaign in frigid weather, the Redcoats have reported that they have captured Quebec and destroyed the Abbeys and nunneries of the region.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america17Desc;After conquering Ontario, the Redcoats were confident that Quebec too would fall swiftly - after all, if British stock had proven unable to resist them, what chance did Frenchmen have? But this proved untrue. For a maiden had appeared among the French, seemingly blessed by God. Around her, the squabbling Frenchmen seemed to rally and swarm like ants around their Queen. The Redcoats were overstretched, demoralised, and suffering from the cold winter, and found themselves unable to hold back the fury of Quebec. Now Redcoat control is collapsing all over America...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america17A;This feels strangely familiar...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america18Title;Rumblings and Rumors;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america18Desc;It is over. The Redcoats have utterly lost control of their holdings in America, and they have been scattered to the four winds. Their soldiers have surrendered, some being absorbed into the civilian populace, others attempting to flee back across the Ocean, very few of whom will ever be seen again. The few survivors tell harowing stories of American savagery and vengeance, hounded by the fear that the demons of the New World will not leave them be, but will pursue them back home...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america18A;They could never bring such a big force over the ocean! Right..?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america19Title;The Wind Comes From The West;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america19Desc;Some years ago, the Redcoat Dominion invaded the distant and fabled land of America. Their invasion ultimately failed, and little has been heard from that land ever since. But now, the worst fears of the Redcoat survivors have been realised - the Americans, galvanised by the shock of the British invasion, and realising that the world beyond the Atlantic truly does still exist, have formed a great horde, and having spent several years building a fleet of ships, have launched a great invasion of the Old World. Their armies have already landed near Knock, in Ireland, and they have unfurled their banner, declaring their intent to establish American hegemony upon this world.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america19A;I've got a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america19B;The legends never prepared us for this...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america20Title;The Redcoats Set Sail;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america20Desc;Everyone has heard the legends of the great British Empire, and of the glory that was hers long ago, before the world broke. But of all the lands of the Crown that were lost, the fabled "America" has always been foremost in the minds of the British. Myths tell of the expulsion of The Queen's forces from America by the demon Washington, and though Her Majesty's forces recovered from this defeat, they never reclaimed those far lands. Recently, this ancient defeat has been much on the mind of the Grandmaster of the Redcoats, who has gathered a large number of soldiers and set off for the far distant land, hoping to conquer it for the Crown once more.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america20A;May the Queen grant them victory;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america20B;Good riddance;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america20C;Lunatics!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

america21Title;Fading Into Memory;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
america21Desc;Several years ago, the Redcoat Dominion crossed the roaring Atlantic and invaded mysterious America. The last anyone heard of them was five years ago, by which point they had defeated almost all of the major realms of Eastern America. Despite this success, the British have been growing concerned - the Redcoats are meant to send annual reports back to the homeland to inform them about the progress of the invasion, but no such reports have been received for five years or so. What could have happened to them? None of the investigators that have set out from Britain have returned, and it may well be that we will never know what happened to them, unless and until they decide to tell us.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

confed3Title;A Crown From The Gutter;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed3Desc;The German peoples have always defended their independence fiercely, both politically and religiously. However, our fragmentation and disunity has also allowed despots and tyrants to make inroads into the heart of Deutschland, enforcing their strange ways upon us. It is clear that this situation is only going to get worse if nothing is done. An idea has begun to grow up throughout Germany in the last few decades, formed and shaped by legends of the Great Reichs of the past, a possible solution to our dissolution. A great union, a confederation of equals united in the defense of Germany, has been proposed, and after much deliberation, the intellectual leaders of the pan-German movement have decided that you would be the most fitting ruler to found this great union. Standing before you in your very throne room, these wise and learned nobles declare their unwavering support for your claim to this grand new endeavour. These men have connections across Germany, and while it is uncertain if anyone would join you, their influence should ensure that the lords of the land will at least give you a hearing.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

confed3B;I don't feel up to this - they should ask someone else;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

confed4Title;Join the Federation?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed4Desc;The German peoples have always defended their independence fiercely, both politically and religiously. However, our fragmentation and disunity has also allowed despots and tyrants to make inroads into the heart of Deutschland, enforcing their strange ways upon us. For decades now, the idea of a pan-German union of equals to defend Germany has grown in popularity, and now it has come to fruition. A group of prominent intellectuals and nobles have proclaimed [From.GetTitledName] the ruler of the newborn German Confederation. These men have connections all over Germany, including in your own court. Many of your advisors are encouraging you to join the Confederation, assuring you that it serves only to defend Germans everywhere, that you would be able to retain your autonomy and armies, as well as being just as eligible for election to the role of Kaiser as any other ruler.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

confed5Title;Rise of the German Confederation;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed5Desc;For centuries, Germany has been splintered, divided between petty kings, tribal warlords, and scattered city-states. This state of disunity has allowed Germans to be dubjected to tyranny, and at last, something has been done about it. Many of the German princes have united together to form a Great Confederation, a loose alliance owing nominal loyalty to [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The new union should allow all Germans to unite their forces for the defence of their homeland, but it remains to be seen if this idealistic dream will endure, or if it will evaporate like the dew on the banks of the Rhine.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed5A;At last, the German's fatherland;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed5B;The Germans uniting? Merciful God, not again...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed5C;This reminds me of an ancient legend...and not a pleasant one;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed5D;Apparently we weren't German enough to be invited;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
confed5E;What a preposterous idea;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
