EVTDESC_ATEOW_realm_event_99999;Legends say that at one time all Slavs where united as brothers, but the great disaster that befell our world tore us apart. Yugoslavia showed that hope of reunification was not lost, and like the Southern Slavs it was only a matter of time until the Western Slavs would find common ground and reunite.\n\nIt was [e_zapadoslavia.Holder.GetFirstNameWithNick] who finally brought the Western Slavs together under the banner of Zapadoslavia. Throughout the new realm, Poles, Czechs and Slovaks celebrate this momentous occasion.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTA_ATEOW_realm_event_99999;Together we will stand as brothers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

form_romaraj_desc;It is said that a long time ago all Romani people were all united under a King of All Gypsies. Perhaps a powerful enough Romani leader can claim that title for himself again.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
stalin.1.d;My master, [From.GetTitledFirstName],has trumped up some scandalous lies claiming to prove that you are an unfaithful traitor!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_stalin1;This can't be good...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
stalin.2.d;We have found convincing proof that your subject,[From.GetTitledFirstName],is a traitor in league with the enemies of Lord Stalin!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA_stalin2;I never trusted them in the first place;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

palmarian.1.d;The Pope in Rome has called for a great Crusade, a massive armed struggle by the whole Catholic world against the infidels. Though you have been brought up to believe that the Roman Pope was a false pretender to the title, you start to wonder if the differences between your two faiths really matter in the face of the obviously greater threat of paganism and heresy plaguing the continent. Perhaps you should help these Crusaders? The Pope in Palmar won't like it, though…;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.1;I will help my Christian brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.1;Let the schismatics fight their own wars;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.2.d;While you've been riding with the train of knights in the Crusade, you've drawn the odd stares of many of the Crusaders. Clearly your Hispanic complexion and accent have drawn their suspicion. Eventually, a burly, heavyset Italian confronts you and asks what a Palmarian is doing in the train of the warriors of God. The crowd is getting restless, and it seems that they'll demand your expulsion soon...;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.2;Beg them to let you stay;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.2;Prove your worth to them with a show of martial skill;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_palmarian.2;Convince them that they're better off with you than without you;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_palmarian.2;Lie and tell them you're not a Palmarian;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_palmarian.2;Storm off and leave the Crusade altogether;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.3.d;During your time on Crusade, you have come by necessity to have strong relationships with many of the knights, and have grown fond of several of them. Sometimes, they talk to you about religion, and you have to face the tough question of why the Palmarian Church even exists at all. Were the visions of one seer really sufficient grounds to split with Rome? And besides that, some of the people here have left everything behind, or at least lost vast sums of money, purely for the privelige of taking part in the Holy War. Certainly you rarely saw this kind of ardor in Spain. Could it be that the Roman Church trul yis the real Catholic Church after all?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_palmarian.3;God has revealed the truth to me!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.3;I believe - but I cannot admit it, I would lose my status.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_palmarian.3;They are pleasant friends, but that doesn't make them right.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_palmarian.3;Gloria In Excelsis Deo;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.4.d;You have received an angry letter from your local bishop back in Spain. In it, he curses you for running off to aid the schismatic Church and warns you that you are playing dangerous games with your soul if you continue to struggle in the service of the False Faith. He urges you to return to Spain immediately.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.4;Tell him bluntly to shut up;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.4;Set off for home immediately - I'm jeopardising my standing too much;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_palmarian.4;Lie and convince him that you are not actually on Crusade, just out of the Kingdom for other reasons;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_palmarian.4;Provide him with a theological rationale for why your actions are justifiable;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.5.d;To your surprise,your group has discovered a small family of Palmarians living in an isolated village near the Crusade target. The more vulgar members of your troop, eager to sate their appetite for cruelty, have smashed up much of their property and taunted them for being schismatics. Your heart burns to see such shameful behavior between Christians - aren't we supposed to be fighting the same enemy? But the others will be angry if you interrupt their 'fun'...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.5;Recompense the family for their loss;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_palmarian.5;There's nothing I can do;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_palmarian.5;Looks like fun! Let me join!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_palmarian.5;We're here to fight FOR Christians, not against them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTE_palmarian.5;Reprimand them publically for their cruelty;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.6.d;A brave soldier has distinguished himself during the Crusade, and has presented himself to you. He claims to be from a relatively poor family and, seeing that you come from a noble house, thinks it'd be better to join you and serve at your court when the Crusade is over.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.6;There's no such thing as too many good men!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.7.d;You have taken part in an assault that captured an important fortification! You have been showered in glory, and the knights are all hailing you as a true crusader!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.7;Deus Vult!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
palmarian.8.d;With the end of the Crusade, the bands of knights depart. You have no choice but to return home.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_palmarian.8;Pleasant or not, it certainly was unforgettable.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
