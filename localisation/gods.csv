ahmadiyya_DESC;A form of Islam native to the Indian subcontinent,Ahmadiyya Muslims believe that a powerful prophet known only as 'Ahmad' came down to India before the Event,announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam,or else be destroyed. To those who accepted him he showed the new way of peace,that Islam would be spread hereon by peaceful means and no longer by the sword. To those who rejected him,he issued condemnation. The Event then fell upon the people for their lack of faith,while the chosen people remained safe,hidden from the wrath. Now,under the guidance of their Caliph,the Ahmadiyya go forth once again,to preach the religion of peace to every corner of the ruined world.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

bahai_DESC;Though distinct from mainstream Shi'ism, the Baha'i faith is considered a Shi'ite heresy in game. This religion preaches in favor of the establishment of world peace, equality, and emphasises the unity of all people and religions. The faith derives from the teachings of Bahï¿½'u'llï¿½h, a pre-event Persian, though following the Event much information on his life has been lost.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
baptist;Baptist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
baptist_DESC;Born in antiquity,Baptism is a strain of Protestantism that is highly charismatic and vigorous. It believes in believers baptism,meaning that only adult believers should be baptised,and that by full bodily immersion in water. They reject most of the Catholic sacraments and follow a Congregational model of Church governance. Baptists after the Event are isolated from their homeland in America,and mostly exist as religious minorites throughout the Old World. In those regions where they are a majority,they form powerful armies to defend their freedom of religion.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

bharatva;Bharatva;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bharatva_DESC;Bharatva is an ideology that came to dominate many parts of India in the chaos following the Event. Basing itself on traditional Vedic beliefs and Scriptures,it is a highly dogmatic religion focussed on the belief that India is a holy land belonging only to the Indians,and that traditional Hindu beliefs and practices are essential to being a 'true' Indian. It calls for the unification of all 'Aryans' under the aegis of a Hindu ruler and the establishment of a Vedic society. Their antagonism toward non-Dharmic religions results in them being the most aggressive of all Indian religions.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

brethren_DESC;The Brethren faith is more a loose group of superstitions from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The corsairs of those seas hold together their man through the fear inspired by the risks of going against the Code of the Sea, and of course against their ruler.

Under rulers chosen by heaven itself (for no ruler that is not chosen could ever be for long King of the Calvinists) the Calvinism faith is prepared to fight to expand the true Christian way.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
catholic_DESC;Surviving through the Event, like it did through so many other crisies great and small, the Catholic however did not come out unscathed. Once the faith of almost all of Europe, now Catholicism survives divided, surrounded by new faiths, some claiming to be the true Christian faith and some swearing to destroy it, the remaining Catholics have to hold together, or be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

These churches had few or no theological differences,and were mostly distinguished by which Rite they used to celebrate the Liturgy. However,after the Event,these differences no longer seemed as significant as the need for cohesion and survival in the face of societal collapse,and so the Syriac Orthodox and Chaldean Catholic Churches joined together. This 'new' old Church is led by the Patriarch of Antioch and All the East.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

dynamitist_DESC;Many of the ancient tales tell of the struggle between Great Nobel and his arch-enemy, the Merchant of Death, who seeks to bring destruction and chaos where Nobel brings life and order. However, there are those that hold that Nobel and the Merchant are in fact one and the same, and that he indeed is the same person under two different disguises. They believe that death is as sacred as life, and therefore that killing (especially in spectacular ways) is just as much a way of worshipping Nobel as is peaceful and upright living.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

finnish_pagan_DESC;The Suomenusko faith experienced a resurgence in the lands of Finland and Karelia in the years since the Event. Fusing traditional belief of the Sami, Finnish and Karelian people, the Suomenusko faith is endemic of the region, and focuses more on protecting Finland, Karelia and the lands of the Sami, rather than expand outwards. Yet, so far no conqueror has ever managed to take those northern lands, and all believers share the faith that it is thanks to the teachings of Ukko and Ilmatar and the bravery of their followers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

It originated from Mahayana Buddhism,and retains many of its traditions,including an emphasis on Bodhisattvas and their intervention in the lives of believers. Traditionally,the Gelugpa are led by the Dalai Lama,but long ago the Panchem Lama was captured by the Chinese,preventing him from recognising the reincarnation of the next Dalai Lama. As a result,the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama was abandoned,and he is now elected by a council of Lamas from around Tibet.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

Taking from both the believes of Orthodox and Christians, and from the teachings of the Prophet of the Sunnis, Yugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor. And the only one that can strengthen it is the Car of all Yugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

However,when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama,they produced a new Panchem Lama,a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Llama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama',but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community,as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was,thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats',school,and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katerinist_DESC;Katerinists hold that, though all of the Tzars are divine, the greatest of them is in fact Katerin, the Great Tzarina. They argue that she is obviously an incarnation of the goddess Mother Russia, whom they regard as the Great Spirit who empowers all Tzars. Mainstream Zarists, however, regard Mother Russia as a metaphor for Russia itself, and anathemise any who believe that she is a literal goddess. As a result of this, Katerinism is a persecuted heresy, though it remains popular among many women, especially the wives of rulers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

Khanists believe that, at the height of his power, Temujin was betrayed by his friend, Han, and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now,they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

Believing the Pope to not be the real envoy of God, and the cult of Saints to be little more than foolishness, the Lutherans followed their founder, the legendary Martin Luther, and spread through Europe, from Scandinavia to Germany. After the Event, however, their power was greatly diminished. The resurgence of pagan faith, and the birth of new ones, put much strain on the Lutheran church.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
malikite;Maliki;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
malikite_DESC;The Malikite, school of thought was originally simply one of many schools of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, and in most parts of the world that is still the case. However, in Post-Event Morocco, the term has come to signify the teachings of a group that, though they still call themselves Sunni Muslims of the Maliki school, have developed some heterodox beliefs, especially as regards who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Malikites of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

They still consider themselves Muslims, but also honor a group of other entities, such as 'The Party' and 'The Lion', whom they believe are agents of Allah. They also hold that Arabs were once united under a single nation, but that they were shattered by the machinations of al-Amriki, in order to destroy the House of Peace. They believe it is their duty to unite the Islamic world to thwart the machinations of al-Amriki and his master, Shaytan.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

nasrini_DESC;First spread to India by Saint Thomas the Apostle over 25 centuries ago,the Nasranis have always been a minority in India. With the chaos of the Event cutting India off from most outside communication,the various Nasrani Churches (both those in communion with the Pope and those in communion with the Eastern Church) united together for the sake of convenience. The example of several holy men has caused the Nasranis to grow in popularity over the last few decades,to the point where they are a majority in a few parts of India,though they are still a minority overall.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

naxalite_DESC;Formed from a blend of Indian tribal religion and a foreign creed imported to the subcontinent before the Event, the Maunaxites have always been an insular and beleaguered group, used to withstanding contempt and attacks from outsiders. The faith chiefly reveres Maushiva, the Red King, who inevitably rises up to destroy corrupt rulers and raise the poor and oppressed. Other deities worshipped include Vishnu, Mao, and, of course, as in every other part of India, the omnipresent Cult of Ghandhi, the great Avatar of Vishnu.;;;;;;;;x,,,;

neovedantic;Neo-Vedantic;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neovedantic_DESC;After the Event,Hinduism began to shift into two broad schools of thought - one highly Nationalistic and dogmatic and one pluralistic and devoted strenuously to social reform. Neo-Vedantism is a word originally used by Bharatvists to disparage the latter movement,claiming that it was not 'authentically Hindu' and represented a break from Vedic tradition. Despite their best efforts,the name has stuck. Neo-Vedantics are highly concerned with the social advancement of all peoples and do not believe that India needs to be reserved strictly for Hindus. They reject the caste system and discrimination against women,arguing that they are incompatible with true Dharma. Though less aggressive than Bharatvaists,they are not pacifistic and are willing to fight in the defense of their religion.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Nousthreskists believe that this Noosphere is capable of altering both human consciousness and physical reality, and that the Event was caused by an accident that misaligned it. They believe that mankind will never advance to a higher level of development without correcting this imbalance, and seek out a mystical entity known as 'the Wish-Granter', which they believe is capable of restoring the Noosphere.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

old_believer_DESC;Originating from a pre-Event split within the Russian Orthodox Church, the reasons for the Old Belivers' existence is lost in the mists of time. They maintain that the Russian Church, under the influence of the demon Nikon, tried to pervert and destroy Christ's Church, creating the Zarist faith. However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'. In-game, the Old Believers are extremely resilient to outside influences both military and proselytic.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

orthodox_DESC;Split from the Catholic church in days lost in the mist of time, the Orthodox Church grew to a great extent before the event, stretching from Greece to Russia. After the Event, however, much like the other Christian faiths, more and more land was lost to new faiths, more and more people turning to forgotten gods and new deities. However, thanks to the Transnistrian Empire, not all hope is lost for the faith that it said to have held together many great Empires.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
orthodox_jewish_DESC;The main branch of the Jewish faith, the Orthodox kept the ancient traditions alive in the changing world before the Event. And once the Event fell upon humanity, more and more Jews joined the Orthodox school, which became the main branch of Judaism once again. Most Jews today are part of the Orthodox faith, and any other is consider an heretic.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

palmarian_DESC;Before the Event, the Virgin Mary sent a vision to a great Saint of the Palmarian faith, showing him that the home of Christianity was not to be Rome, but El Palmar de Troya. While weak and almost gone before the Event, the true faith gained new power in the years after, through the claim that the lack of faith in the revelations of the Virgin Mary that caused God to make the Event fall upon humanity. With all of Spain following now the Palmarian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

petrist_DESC;Unlike mainstream Zarism, Petrism is a strictly montheistic faith. It holds that there was and is in fact only one Tzar, the immortal Peter the Great. All other Tzars are impostors, seeking to steal from him his rightful worship. They are thus regarded as the worst kind of heretics by mainstream Zarists, as they threaten the very core of Zarist doctrine. In-game, Petrists benefit from increased martial and learning stats, as Petrism teaches that one should strive to emulate Peter in his advances in the fields of science and military strategy.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

prussianist_DESC;Prussianism is a heretical branch that grew out of the Lutheran church in east Germany. The Church retains many Christian doctrines,but have added extra doctrines out of step with mainstream Protestantism (and Christianity more generally). They believe that,in addition to the Prophets of old,God later sent a prophet to the Germans,known as 'The Kaiser'. They believe that the Kaiser saved the German people from the assualt of the heretical Pope,who had seceded from the true Church for political reasons. In-game,the Prussianists are far more militant and aggressive than mainstream Lutherans,believing in the importance of martial skill and valor.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

It rejects the caste system and believes that all people can come to true knowledge of God. Though technically monotheistic,its theology is markedly different from that of the Abrahamic religions,and could easily be described as Monistic or Panentheistic. In-game,Sikhs receive stronger armies due to their commitment to armed defence of their religion against larger,aggressive religions.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
stalinist;Stalinist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the one and only true Tzar, drawing on old texts that list him among the Protectors of Russia, along with the multitude of statues and temples dedicated to his name. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on, and the Stalinists were driven south by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and 'class struggle' can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many, many enemies.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

sufi;Sufi;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sufi_DESC;Properly speaking, Sufism is a tradition of mystical thought common to all kinds of Islam, but only in Central Africa have such schools come to dominate the religious landscape. Focussing on the inward, mystical dimension of Islam, the isolation of the post-Event world has caused African Sufis to develop unique characteristics that distinguish them from more mainstream Islam. Some sects have adopted beliefs from native African paganism, while others are more conservative and stick closer to Sunni orthodoxy. Yet others draw inspiration from the Salafist and Wahhabi movements in West Africa, attempting to 'purify' Islam from foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

The Queen was given dominion over the Summer, and the knight became the King of winter. Celebrations usually include morris dancing, maypoles, wicker men, and vast amounts of cider.

thelemic_DESC;The Old Thelema faith, been abandoned centuries ago by most inhabitants of the British Empire in favour of the current Thelemites faith. Old Thelema focused more on the personal will of the individual, and for this was considered the ultimate cause of the Civil War in the 23rd century. Since then, only pockets of Old Thelemites have survived, while the new faith and the Summer Queen hold the country.

trotskyite_DESC;A small offshoot from mainstream Stalinism, Trotskyists believe that Lord Stalin was in fact a traitor to Russia, and that Trotsky, an obscure figure hated by Stalinists but unknown to any other sect, was in fact the true hero of Russia. They teach that Lord Stalin betrayed his comrades, for power, and that the true class struggle must be fought through prayer and inner devotion, resorting to violence only when necessary.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

Such revelation means that every single Christian Church of the Old World is a vile heresy! As such, Transatlantics declared themselves the representatives of the Pope in New Rome, and decided to take it upon themselves to spread the word of One True Pope.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They claim that only they practice true Islam and that all others are in fact practicing 'shirk',or idolatry.

Though He created all men, most of them turned their backs on him and followed strange beliefs. Thus He abandoned them, and bestowed his favor only upon Holy Russia, his chosen people. Zarists hold that this Great Spirit bestows his grace upon a temporal ruler, who is chosen to be Tzar. The Tzar is blessed by this Spirit, commands the full and unconditional obedience of the people, and upon death is taken up to Heaven and deified. Many Zarists express their piety through prayer to former Tzars and pilgrimages to their burial sites.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority. That changed in the post-Event world, where a new order of monks, called the Neeraji, vigorously proselytise for the faith, resulting in a great resurgence of Jainism throughout India.;;;;;;;;;x,,
