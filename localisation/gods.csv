Ahmadi Muslims believe that a messianic figure known as the Mahdi, named Ahmad, came down to India before the Event, announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam, or else be destroyed.

The theology of this heresy ponders the implications of the event that destroyed the world of men identifying It, as many Christians did, with the Last Judgement but in particular, this branch of the orthodox faithful asked themself why if the apocalypse came to the world haven't the dead been resurrected and the rightful called at the right of the Father. There are different interpretations of why this happened: some believe that during the Event the apocalypse happened in full, the dead were revived and the children of God judged and that thus what is called world today is nothing but one of the tortures of hell. Others believe that the event has only heralded the apocalypse and the only reason why the dead haven't been resurrected Is that the Earth was so full of sin that God rebuked it and that thus the world exists as a limbo between the Judgement of God and the damnation of Hell.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the death of her prophet, killed by the ignorance of traitors, Madame Guillotine was left unfed, and in the end it was humanity that paid the price in the form of the Event, when she took all the lives she was denied for too long. The Jacobinists have sworn that this will never again happen. Madame Guillotine shall never again be left without food, no matter the cost.

Taking from both the beliefs of Orthodox and Catholics, and additionally from the teachings of the Sunni Prophet, Yugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor. And the only one that can strengthen it is the Car of all Yugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katerinist_DESC;Katerinists hold that, though all of the Tzars are divine, the greatest of them is in fact Katerin, the Great Tzarina. They argue that she is obviously an incarnation of the goddess Mother Russia, whom they regard as the Great Spirit who empowers all Tzars. Mainstream Zarists, however, regard Mother Russia as a metaphor for Russia itself, and anathematize any who believe that she is a literal goddess. As a result of this, Katerinism is a persecuted heresy, though it remains popular among many women, especially the wives of rulers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

Khanists believe that, at the height of his power, Temujin was betrayed by his friend, Han, and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now, they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

Requiring strict discipline of their followers and of the priests they recreated their bishoprics across the major kingdoms, which in turn flowed into the militaries and economies of the enterprising rulers.

Satanael allied itself with the hero Luther who sought out warriors and true believers to topple the pope and his false god.

The Ma'aravim have long since integrated into the American system and thus are far removed from the affairs of old world Judaism.

Initially part of the greater American Jewish community, in time, the Hasidic movement had effectively split from the rest of Ma'aravi Judaism and largely bases itself in more rural Jewish communities across the United States. While they agree about core principles of Hasidic Judaism, many sects have arose following the teachings of several important Rebbes.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
malikite_DESC;The Malikite school of thought was originally simply one of many schools of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, and in most parts of the world that is still the case. However, in Post-Event Morocco, the term has come to signify the teachings of a group that, though they still call themselves Sunni Muslims of the Maliki school, have developed some heterodox beliefs, especially as regards who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Malikites of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

They Hold that under the Empire of Mesopotamia they ruled all the east as one great domain of god. Yet, they were shattered apart by the machinations of Hashem and His wife, the Queen, who led an Immortal Empire against them, and Shaytan, who gave them power.

This is the origin of spirits with some being the human perspective of concepts and others being the impact humans have left on the collective mind after their death, enabling them to somewhat live on post death.

However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'.

While weak and almost gone before the Event, the true faith gained new power in the years after, through the claim that the lack of faith in the revelations of the Virgin Mary that caused God to make the Event fall upon humanity. With all of Spain following now the Palmarian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

They are thus regarded as the worst kind of heretics by mainstream Zarists due to their outward hostility towards the other cults.

Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and loyalty can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many enemies including the Great Holy Spirit who wishes to bring ruin to all Stalinist realms for Lord Stalin's usurpation. They also believe that similar to their lord they may become divine like a Tzar by consuming the essence of one.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

thelemic_DESC;The Old Thelema faith, abandoned centuries ago by most inhabitants of the British Empire in favour of the current Thelema faith. Old Thelema focused more on the personal will of the individual, and for this was considered the ultimate cause of the Civil War in the 23rd century.

They teach that Lord Stalin betrayed his comrades for power in order to ascend, and that the true worship must be brought through prayer and inner devotion, resorting to violence only when necessary.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep it sitting on a golden throne and keep insisting it talks to them and offers them advice. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zarist_DESC;Originating long before the Event, Zarism is a religion that holds that the world was created by a powerful spirit. Though he created all men, the majority of his children turned their backs on him and followed strange beliefs. Thus He abandoned them, and bestowed his favor only upon Holy Russia, his chosen people. Zarists hold that this Great Holy Spirit bestows his grace upon a temporal ruler, who is chosen to be Tzar. The Tzar is blessed by this Spirit, commands the full and unconditional obedience of the people, and upon death is taken up to Heaven and deified. Many Zarists express their piety through prayer to former Tzars and pilgrimages to their burial sites. Beneath the Tzars many of their servants are worshipped as minor holy men, though only on a regional level. Examples of these minor saints are Saint Benjamin in St.Petersburg or Saint Gennady in Novgorod, who both fought those who would challenge the will of the Great Holy Spirit and overthrow the Tzar.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority.

For example, these Christians pray to their pious ancestors for guidance in a similar way as the Catholics of the west and believe that their God maintains a Celestial Order to the world. Here in the west the faith has come to be associated with the only other protestant faith, the more well established baptist faith and is viewed as a de facto heresy.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

They argued for the persuit of reason, implementation of the scientific method and liberalisation of society overall. After the Event though Jadidism became an "umbrella term" used to describe to preserve Muslim Turkic identity in the face of post-deluge chaos. As such it absorbed various Turkic folk beliefs such as reverence to the ancient spirits of Su Anasy and Su Babasy, Grandmother and Grandfather of all the Turkic folk. What little knowledge of pre-event world the Turkic people had preserved was also incorporated. The most venerated figure in Jadidism is Taraqqiy.

However, in the intervening centuries, they have dwindled somewhat, being further subdivided into sects. In the chaos of the Event, many Ismaili sects have been absorbed by others, and now most Imsailis accept the Aga Khan as their lord.

They attended and conferred blessings on all important communal and life-cycle events, and also acted as mediators between clans and tribes.
