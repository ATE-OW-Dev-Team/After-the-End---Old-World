finnish_pagan_DESC;The Suomenusko faith experienced a resurgence in the lands of Finland and Karelia in the years since the Event. Fusing traditional belief of the Sami, Finnish and Karelian people, the Suomenusko faith is endemic of the region, and focuses more on protecting Finland, Karelia and the lands of the Sami, rather than expand outwards. Yet, so far no conqueror has ever managed to take those northern lands, and all believers share the faith that it is thanks to the teachings of Ukko and Ilmatar and the bravery of their followers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
finnish_reformed_pagan_DESC;The Suomenusko faith experienced a resurgence in the lands of Finland and Karelia in the years since the Event. Fusing traditional belief of the Sami, Finnish and Karelian people, the Suomenusko faith is endemic of the region, and focuses more on protecting Finland, Karelia and the lands of the Sami, rather than expand outwards. Now united, the faith is better prepared to defend the homeland and people to Väinämäinen against the Devilmen, the Crown worshipers, the Cross, and any other faith that may come to face them.;;;;;;;;;x,,
catholic_DESC;Surviving through the Event, like it did through so many other crisies great and small, the Catholic however did not come out unscathed. Once the faith of almost all of Europe, now Catholicism survives divided, surrounded by new faiths, some claiming to be the true Christian faith and some swearing to destroy it, the remaining Catholics have to hold together, or be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
palmarian_DESC;Before the Event, the Virgin Mary sent a vision to a great Saint of the Palmarian faith, showing him that the home of Christianity was not to be Rome, but El Palmar de Troya. While weak and almost gone before the Event, the true faith gained new power in the years after, through the claim that the lack of faith in the revelations of the Virgin Mary that caused God to make the Event fall upon humanity. With all of Spain following now the Palmarian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
lutheran_DESC;The Lutheran faith was born centuries before the Event. Believing the Pope to not be the real envoy of God, and the cult of Saints to be little more than foolishness, the Lutherans followed their founder, the legendary Martin Luther, and spread through Europe, from Scandinavia to Germany. After the Event, however, their power was greatly diminished. The resurgence of pagan faith, and the birth of new ones, put much strain on the Lutheran church.;;;;;;;;;x,,
prussianist_DESC;Prussianism is a heretical branch that grew out of the Lutheran church in east Germany. The Church retains many Christian doctrines,but have added extra doctrines out of step with mainstream Protestantism (and Christianity more generally). They believe that,in addition to the Prophets of old,God later sent a prophet to the Germans,known as 'The Kaiser'. They believe that the Kaiser saved the German people from the assualt of the heretical Pope,who had seceded from the true Church for political reasons. In-game,the Prussianists are far more militant and aggressive than mainstream Lutherans,believing in the importance of martial skill and valor.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
orthodox_DESC;Split from the Catholic church in days lost in the mist of time, the Orthodox Church grew to a great extent before the event, stretching from Greece to Russia. After the Event, however, much like the other Christian faiths, more and more land was lost to new faiths, more and more people turning to forgotten gods and new deities. However, thanks to the Transnistrian Empire, not all hope is lost for the faith that it said to have held together many great Empires.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
old_believer_DESC;Originating from a pre-Event split within the Russian Orthodox Church, the reasons for the Old Belivers' existence is lost in the mists of time. They maintain that the Russian Church, under the influence of the demon Nikon, tried to pervert and destroy Christ's Church, creating the Zarist faith. However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'. In-game, the Old Believers are extremely resilient to outside influences both military and proselytic.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
calvinist_DESC;Born before the Event on the mountains of Switzerland, some say from a great sage born in the depth of Alps, the Calvinist faith has greatly grown after the Event. Under rulers chosen by heaven itself (for no ruler that is not chosen could ever be for long King of the Calvinists) the Calvinism faith is prepared to fight to expand the true Christian way.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
jugoslavist_DESC;The youngest of all Christian churches, the Yugoslavist faith was born when the Car of Yugoslavia, hard pressed in keeping his diverse Empire united, made a desperate attempt, calling a great Council of all holy men in his lands, fusing all faiths in his domains in a single religion and forcing them all to accept it or lose their heads. Taking from both the believes of Orthodox and Christians, and from the teachings of the Prophet of the Sunnis, Yugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor. And the only one that can strengthen it is the Car of all Yugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;x,,
celtic_pagan_DESC;The first cult that came from the west, the Druidic faith has taken over land in the far island of Iceland, and now looks to the lands of Europe, so richer and greener then the homeland of this new lord. With it's new, strange gods, many ask themselves if this is the forebearer of more to come.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
celtic_pagan_reformed_DESC;The first cult that came from the west, the Druidic faith took over the lands of Iceland. From there, it has grown and strengthened. And now that so many rulers and followers pray to the Dagda and the other gods of the faith, it can be truly said that the religion from the west was truly destined to change the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
thelemic_reformed_DESC;The Thelema faith was founded by the great prophet Aleister Crowley long before the Event. However, only after it the faith truly became wildy accepted. And once the Lord Protector of Britain converted, the faith truly rose to it's modern power, ascending to national religion of the British Empire.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
novelist_DESC;Novelists were gatherers of knowledge of old. Ancient and mystics tomes holding depiction and exploits of past gods and heroes were reunited into one holy book, the Novel, telling the story of what really happened before the Fall. Some call it 'fiction', but Novelists firmly believe that they are precise and accurate transcriptions of the past, narrating stories of heroes worthy of worship, upon which one should seek the same fate.;Title;Title;;Title;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

folklorist_DESC;A belief system with roots stretching back shortly after the Event,Folklorism draws from folklore, ancient myth, and the popular culture of Great Russia. They worship a diverse pantheon of deities,which are believed to possess magnificent powers which they sometimes grant to mortal followers in exchange for worship. The most powerful deity is the mighty Mother Russia,patron goddess of Great Russia and conqueror of all between the White and Black Seas.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
folklorist_reformed_DESC;A belief system with roots stretching back shortly after the Event,Folklorism draws from folklore, ancient myth, and the popular culture of Great Russia. The religion has been reformed and restructured,given a proper basis on which to base itself so that it may resist the advances of Crown and Cross.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
nobelian_DESC;Since the Fall, Nobelians worshipped an old, wise, bearded god who helped mankind to achieve marvels in science, literature and peace, sending holy men and saints on Earth to guide humanity to greatness. The numerous medals with the face of God on them proved he was largely worshipped in the old world, and if Laureates are nowadays rarer than before, faith can be put in Nobel to lead, once again, mankind on the path to glory.;Title;Title;;Title;;;;;;;;;x,,
bahai_DESC;Though distinct from mainstream Shi'ism, the Baha'i faith is considered a Shi'ite heresy in game. This religion preaches in favor of the establishment of world peace, equality, and emphasises the unity of all people and religions. The faith derives from the teachings of Bahä'u'lläh, a pre-event Persian, though following the Event much information on his life has been lost.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
mesopotamian_DESC;Mesopotamianism is a sect of Islam regarded as heretical by mainstream Muslims. They still consider themselves Muslims, but also honor a group of other entities, such as 'The Party' and 'The Lion', whom they believe are agents of Allah. They also hold that Arabs were once united under a single nation, but that they were shattered by the machinations of al-Amriki, in order to destroy the House of Peace. They believe it is their duty to unite the Islamic world to thwart the machinations of al-Amriki and his master, Shaytan.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
hellenic_pagan_DESC;After the Event, the Hellenic faith has resurfaced. Guided by the teachings left behind in statues and ruins, the people of Greece turned their back to the Orthodox faith, accusing it's God of failing to protect them during the Event, and claiming that the gods punished them for the lack of sacrifices to their ancient altars. And so, the Hellenic faith resurfaced and thrived, expanding through all of Greece. Only the unification of all the Balkan countries in a single nation managed to stop them. Many consider them defeated, but this may be wrong.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

And so, the Hellenic faith resurfaced and thrived, expanding through all of Greece. Only the unification of all the Balkan countries in a single nation managed to stop them. Despite the hardship they had to endure, the Hellenists ultimately pulled together and fought back, uniting the faith and it's people.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
orthodox_jewish_DESC;The main branch of the Jewish faith, the Orthodox kept the ancient traditions alive in the changing world before the Event. And once the Event fell upon humanity, more and more Jews joined the Orthodox school, which became the main branch of Judaism once again. Most Jews today are part of the Orthodox faith, and any other is consider an heretic.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
reformed_DESC;Once a prominent school of thought in Judaism, the Reformed faith has since the Event fallen out of favour in most Jewish community. Today, only a handful of people still preach the idea that the Reformed faith is the one true school of Judaism.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
brethren_DESC;The Brethren faith is more a loose group of superstitions from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The corsairs of those seas hold together their man through the fear inspired by the risks of going against the Code of the Sea, and of course against their ruler. Most rulers turn a blind eye on the acts and rituals of the Brethren, especially because the Corsairs bring in a fair profit.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
jacobinist_DESC;The followers of the Jacobinist faith believe that Robespierre, savior of humanity, came to the world to placate the eternal hunger of Madame Guillotine. After the death of her prophet, killed by the ignorance of traitors, Madame Guillotine was left unfed, and in the end it was humanity that paid the price in the form of the Event, when she took all the lives she was denied for too long. The Jacobinist have sworn that this will never again happen. Madame Guillotine shall never again be left without food, no matter the cost. It is a sacrifice of few for the sake of many.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'. In-game, the Old Believers are extremely resilient to outside influences both military and proselytic.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
zarist_DESC;Originating long before the Event, Zarism is a national religion that holds that the world was created by a powerful spirit. Though He created all men, most of them turned their backs on him and followed strange beliefs. Thus He abandoned them, and bestowed his favor only upon Holy Russia, his chosen people. Zarists hold that this Great Spirit bestows his grace upon a temporal ruler, who is chosen to be Tzar. The Tzar is blessed by this Spirit, commands the full and unconditional obedience of the people, and upon death is taken up to Heaven and deified. Many Zarists express their piety through prayer to former Tzars and pilgrimages to their burial sites.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the one and only true Tzar, drawing on old texts that list him among the Protectors of Russia, along with the multitude of statues and temples dedicated to his name. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on, and the Stalinists were driven south by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and 'class struggle' can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many, many enemies.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
katerinist_DESC;Katerinists hold that, though all of the Tzars are divine, the greatest of them is in fact Katerin, the Great Tzarina. They argue that she is obviously an incarnation of the goddess Mother Russia, whom they regard as the Great Spirit who empowers all Tzars. Mainstream Zarists, however, regard Mother Russia as a metaphor for Russia itself, and anathemise any who believe that she is a literal goddess. As a result of this, Katerinism is a persecuted heresy, though it remains popular among many women, especially the wives of rulers.;;;;;;;;;x,
petrist;Petrist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
petrist_DESC;Unlike mainstream Zarism, Petrism is a strictly montheistic faith. It holds that there was and is in fact only one Tzar, the immortal Peter the Great. All other Tzars are impostors, seeking to steal from him his rightful worship. They are thus regarded as the worst kind of heretics by mainstream Zarists, as they threaten the very core of Zarist doctrine. In-game, Petrists benefit from increased martial and learning stats, as Petrism teaches that one should strive to emulate Peter in his advances in the fields of science and military strategy.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

trotskyite_DESC;A small offshoot from mainstream Stalinism, Trotskyists believe that Lord Stalin was in fact a traitor to Russia, and that Trotsky, an obscure figure hated by Stalinists but unknown to any other sect, was in fact the true hero of Russia. They teach that Lord Stalin betrayed his comrades, for power, and that the true class struggle must be fought through prayer and inner devotion, resorting to violence only when necessary.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
titoist;Titoist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
titoist_DESC;An obscure branch of Stalinism, Titoism holds that Tito, legendary founder of Yugoslavia, was the true ruler of Russia, by virtue of his title as Ruler of All Slavs. An extremely small and regional sect, they are unpopular with nearly every other religious group.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

Khanists believe that,at the height of his power,Temujin was betrayed by his friend,Han,and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now,they ride ever onward over the plains,hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x,,

EVTDESCJB1;For centuries, an ancient belief system has existed in Europe,though it has usually existed underground in small cabals or among the heights of academia. These people,called 'The Jacobins',believe firmly that the Event was caused by Europe's loss of fervour in the worship of the great goddess,Madame Guillotine. Following the teachings of the Prophet Robespierre,they hold that Madame Guillotine must constantly be sated with fresh blood,lest mankind be punished with a second Event. For most of their existence they have been persecuted for their insane and dangerous beliefs,but in recent days a charismatic young preacher has managed to convince many that the Second Event is nigh,and that dramatic action is necessary to avert the End. Hidden Jacobinists have arisen from their caves to aid him,bolstered by an army of peasants drawn by his apparent mystical powers and charismatic preaching. They now seek to war against the whole world,in order to save it.;;;;;;;;;x

wahhabi_DESC;Originating long before the Event,Wahhabism is a puritanical strain of Islam originating from the Nejd. It holds that over the centuries,the Islam practiced by mainstream Sunnis had become 'corrupted' with accretions such as prayer to the saints and making pilgrimages to the tombs of holy men. They claim that only they practice true Islam and that all others are in fact practicing 'shirk',or idolatry. This attitude has led to them being highly aggressive,even towards other Muslims.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
