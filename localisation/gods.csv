ahmadiyya_DESC;A form of Islam native to the Indian subcontinent, Ahmadiyya Muslims believe that a powerful prophet known only as 'Ahmad' came down to India before the Event, announcing that the people must repent and turn back to the True Islam, or else be destroyed. To those who accepted him he showed the new way of peace, and proclaimed that Islam would no longer be spread by the sword, but by more peaceful means. To those who rejected him, he issued condemnations. The Event then fell upon the people for their lack of faith, while the chosen people remained safe, hidden from the wrath. Now, under the guidance of their Caliph, the Ahmadiyya go forth once again, to preach the religion of peace to every corner of the ruined world.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

bahai_DESC;Though distinct from mainstream Shi'ism, the Baha'i faith is considered a Shi'ite heresy in game. This religion preaches in favor of the establishment of world peace, equality, and emphasises the unity of all people and religions. The faith derives from the teachings of Bah�'u'll�h, a pre-event Persian, though following the Event much information on his life has been lost.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

baptist_DESC;Born in antiquity, Baptism is a strain of Protestantism that is highly charismatic and vigorous. It believes that only adult believers should be baptised, and that too by full bodily immersion in water. They reject most of the Catholic sacraments and follow a Congregational model of Church governance. Baptists after the Event are isolated from their homeland in America, and mostly exist as religious minorities throughout the Old World. In the northeastern region of India, where they have become a majority, they form powerful armies to defend their freedom of religion.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Under rulers chosen by heaven itself (for no ruler that is not chosen could ever be King of the Calvinists for long) the Calvinist faith is prepared to fight to expand the true Christian way.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
catholic_DESC;Surviving through the Event, like it did through so many other crises great and small, the Catholic faith however did not come out unscathed. Once the faith of almost all of Europe, now Catholicism survives divided, surrounded by new faiths, some claiming to be the true Christian faith and some swearing to destroy it.

These churches had few or no theological differences, and were mostly distinguished by which Rite they used to celebrate the Liturgy. However, after the Event, these differences no longer seemed as significant as the need for cohesion and survival in the face of societal collapse, and so the Syriac Orthodox and Chaldean Catholic Churches joined together. This 'new' old Church is led by the Patriarch of Antioch and All the East.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

However, there are those that hold that Nobel and the Merchant are in fact one and the same, and that he indeed is the same person under two different disguises. They believe that death is as sacred as life, and therefore that killing (especially in spectacular ways) is just as much a way of worshipping Nobel as is peaceful and upright living.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Yet, so far no conqueror has ever managed to take those northern lands, and all believers share the faith that it is thanks to the teachings of Ukko and Ilmatar and the bravery of their followers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

It originated from Mahayana Buddhism,and retains many of its traditions,including an emphasis on Bodhisattvas and their intervention in the lives of believers. Traditionally,the Gelugpa are led by the Dalai Lama, but long ago the Panchem Lama was captured by the Chinese, preventing him from recognising the reincarnation of the next Dalai Lama. As a result, the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama was abandoned, and he is now elected by a council of Lamas from around Tibet.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

Taking from both the beliefs of Orthodox and Catholics, and additionally from the teachings of the Sunni Prophet, Yugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor.

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x,,,
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katerinist_DESC;Katerinists hold that, though all of the Tzars are divine, the greatest of them is in fact Katerin, the Great Tzarina. They argue that she is obviously an incarnation of the goddess Mother Russia, whom they regard as the Great Spirit who empowers all Tzars. Mainstream Zarists, however, regard Mother Russia as a metaphor for Russia itself, and anathematize any who believe that she is a literal goddess. As a result of this, Katerinism is a persecuted heresy, though it remains popular among many women, especially the wives of rulers.;;;;;;;;;x,,,

Khanists believe that, at the height of his power, Temujin was betrayed by his friend, Han, and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now, they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

malikite;Maliki;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
malikite_DESC;The Malikite school of thought was originally simply one of many schools of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, and in most parts of the world that is still the case. However, in Post-Event Morocco, the term has come to signify the teachings of a group that, though they still call themselves Sunni Muslims of the Maliki school, have developed some heterodox beliefs, especially as regards who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Malikites of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

They Hold that under the Empire of Mesopotamia they ruled all the east as one great domain of god. Yet, they were shattered apart by the machinations of Hashem and His wife, the Queen, who led an Immortal Empire against them, and Shaytan, who gave them power. They believe that it is their destiny to reunify the Islamic world and to do a final battle with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

With the chaos of the Event cutting India off from most outside communication, the various Nasrani Churches (both those in communion with the Pope and those in communion with the Eastern Church) united together for the sake of convenience.

Nousthreskists believe that this Noosphere is capable of altering both human consciousness and physical reality, and that the Event was caused by an accident that misaligned it. They believe that mankind will never advance to a higher level of development without correcting this imbalance, and seek out a mystical entity known as 'the Wish-Granter', which they believe is capable of restoring the Noosphere.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Ancient and mystics tomes holding depiction and exploits of past gods and heroes were reunited into one holy book, the Novel, telling the story of what really happened before the Fall. Some call it 'fiction', but Novelists firmly believe that they are precise and accurate transcriptions of the past, narrating stories of heroes worthy of worship, upon which one should seek the same fate.;Title;Title;;Title;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

old_believer_DESC;Originating from a pre-Event split within the Russian Orthodox Church, the reasons for the Old Believers' existence is lost in the mists of time. They maintain that the Russian Church, under the influence of the demon Nikon, tried to pervert and destroy Christ's Church, creating the Zarist faith. However, their ancestors escaped into the wild, where they hid until eventually the wrath of God destroyed the apostate Russia, no longer deserving the title of 'Holy'. In-game, the Old Believers are extremely resilient to outside influences both military and proselytic.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

orthodox_DESC;Split from the Catholic church in days lost in the mist of time, the Orthodox Church grew to a great extent before the event, stretching from Greece to Russia. After the Event, however, much like the other Christian faiths, more and more land was lost to new faiths, more and more people turning to forgotten gods and new deities. However, thanks to the Transnistrian Empire, not all hope is lost for the faith that it said to have held together many great Empires.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
orthodox_jewish_DESC;The main branch of the Jewish faith, the Orthodox kept the ancient traditions alive in the changing world before the Event. And once the Event fell upon humanity, more and more Jews joined the Orthodox school, which became the main branch of Judaism once again.

While weak and almost gone before the Event, the true faith gained new power in the years after, through the claim that the lack of faith in the revelations of the Virgin Mary that caused God to make the Event fall upon humanity. With all of Spain following now the Palmarian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

petrist_DESC;Unlike mainstream Zarism, Petrism is a strictly montheistic faith. It holds that there was and is in fact only one Tzar, the immortal Peter the Great. All other Tzars are impostors, seeking to steal from him his rightful worship. They are thus regarded as the worst kind of heretics by mainstream Zarists, as they threaten the very core of Zarist doctrine. In-game, Petrists benefit from increased martial and learning stats, as Petrism teaches that one should strive to emulate Peter in his advances in the fields of science and military strategy.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

The Church retains many Christian doctrines,but have added extra doctrines out of step with mainstream Protestantism (and Christianity more generally). They believe that,in addition to the Prophets of old, God later sent a prophet to the Germans,known as 'The Kaiser'. They believe that the Kaiser saved the German people from the assualt of the heretical Pope, who had seceded from the true Church for political reasons, and created the Kaiserreich as the Kingdom of God on Earth.

It rejects the caste system and believes that all people can come to true knowledge of God. Though technically monotheistic, its theology is markedly different from that of the Abrahamic religions, and could easily be described as Monistic or Panentheistic. In-game, Sikhs receive stronger armies due to their commitment to armed defence of their religion against larger, more aggressive religions.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the one and only true Tzar, drawing on old texts that list him among the Protectors of Russia, along with the multitude of statues and temples dedicated to his name. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on, and the Stalinists were driven south by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and 'class struggle' can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many, many enemies.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

sufi_DESC;Properly speaking, Sufism is a tradition of mystical thought common to all kinds of Islam, but only in Central Africa have such schools come to dominate the religious landscape. Focussing on the inward, mystical dimension of Islam, the isolation of the post-Event world has caused African Sufis to develop unique characteristics that distinguish them from more mainstream Islam. Some sects have adopted beliefs from native African paganism, while others are more conservative and stick closer to Sunni orthodoxy. Yet others draw inspiration from the Salafist and Wahhabi movements in West Africa, attempting to 'purify' Islam from foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep it sitting on a golden throne and keep insisting it talks to them and offers them advice. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zarists hold that this Great Spirit bestows his grace upon a temporal ruler, who is chosen to be Tzar. The Tzar is blessed by this Spirit, commands the full and unconditional obedience of the people, and upon death is taken up to Heaven and deified.

After the Event though Jadidism became an "umbrella term" used to describe to preserve Muslim Turkic identity in the face of post-deluge chaos. As such it absorbed various Turkic folk beliefs such as reverence to the ancient spirits of Su Anasy and Su Babasy, Grandmother and Grandfather of all the Turkic folk. What little knowledge of pre-event world the Turkic people had preserved was also incorporated. The most venerated figure in Jadidism is Taraqqiy.

They roam the steppes, seeking metal objects of power through which they can connect with The Steel Godhead.

ismaili_DESC;The Ismaili Shi'ites are those who accept Isma'il ibn Jafar as the legitimate successor to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, unlike the mainstream Twelver Shias, who accept his younger brother Musa al-Kadhim. Historically, the Ismailis reached the peak of their political power in the age long before the Event, with the Fatimid Caliphate. However, in the intervening centuries, they have dwindled somewhat, being further subdivided into sects. In the chaos of the Event, many Ismaili sects have been absorbed by others, and now most Imsailis accept the Aga Khan as their lord. Theologically, Ismailis tend to be more focussed on the interior, mystical elements of Islam than are Twelvers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shiite_DESC;Originating in the split between those who supported Ali as the successor to Muhammad and those who supported Abu Bakr, Shia Islam is the second largest grouping of Muslims in the world. The overwhelmingly dominant school of Shia thought is the Jafari, or "Twelver" school, holding that there exist Twelve divinely-ordained Imams, with the Twelfth and final Imam having been divinely hidden from the world since the tenth century, and who will return as the promised Mahdi at the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

However, the recent fall of Lithuania to infidels has disgusted many of the zealous locals, who have banded together in an attempt to defend the faith.

yersenism_DESC;Yarsani faith comes from the northwest region of Iran and northern Iraq, it has roots in indigenous Persian faiths like Zoroastrianism, to whom they are closely related. Yarsani believe in the reincarnation of the soul, but also of God, and that in each Epoch there are seven Haftan who accompany God on earth in mortal form. The Last Major presence of God on Earth was Soltan Sahak, who is said to have been born from his virgin mother, and when he grew of age he instructed the Kurdish tribes in the dogma of Yarsan. With the collapse of the world order, the Yarsani have declared it to be the fifth epoch, no longer bound to their mountain lands they strike forth in their search for the next incarnation of God.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

All adherents north of the Amazon river are led by the Archbishop of Manaus, although he is only a subordinate of the Church's true leader in São Paulo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
