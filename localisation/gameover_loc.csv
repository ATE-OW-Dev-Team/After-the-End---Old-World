DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Capet, descended from Robert the Strong who was a power figure during the reign of Charles the Bald. His descendants would be Kings of France in 1066. Although by 1322 the main line would die out, cadet branches still ruled in 1337 as Kings of France, Portugal, Naples, Hungary and Navarre. Cadet branches would also hold the Duchies of Brittany, Burgundy, Bourbon, Provence and Achaea. One further cadet branch would hold the dignity of Emperor as Latin Emperors of Constantinople. Truly the greatest dynasty of medieval Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Habsburg. On the face of it, things were not looking very good for the Habsburg family in 1066. As minor Swiss counts, their status inside the Empire was fairly negligible compared to great territorial magnates of 11th century Germany. A policy of tactical marriages saw the family lands expand steadily, and it was during the chaos that gripped the Empire in the late 13h and early 14th century that the family were elected to the office of Holy Roman Empire. Although unable to hold the office they were able to use this a springboard to secure the Duchy of Austria for the dynasty. With this power base, the family would go on to dominate the politics of Central Europe until 1918.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN3_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Rurikovich, descendants of the Swedish Viking Rurik who established a state in Rus (now in modern Russia and Ukraine) in the 9th century. The policy of dividing lands between heirs led to the state fragmenting and the various family groups would feud with each other. This left them too divided to cope with the 13th century Mongol invasion. The great principalities fell one by one to Batu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, and were forced to pay tribute to the victorious Mongols. The family itself survived and would rise again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN4_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House d'Ivrea, a dynasty with illustrious ancestors, but by 1066 very much down on its luck - from Kings of Italy to minor counts in Burgundy. It looked like a dynasty whose day had passed. Then came a lucky marriage and the Kingdoms of Castile and Leon passed into the family holdings, turning House d'Ivrea again into one of the key players on the European stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Piast. The eponymous founder of this dynasty was by legend a wheelwright before becoming King of Poland. The family held Poland throughout the period, and despite the Kingdom being split were able to unite the country and make Poland strong again. Other members of the Dynasty were part of the Holy Roman Empire as Dukes of Silesia. In 1337 Poland was ruled by its greatest Piast King and preparing to advance against the Mongols.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Komnenos. If we exclude Isaac, who had launched a successful coup to become Emperor in 1057, the Komnenos family were loyal servants of the Byzantine Empire. In the chaos following the Seljuk victory at Manzikert, the Komnenos family followed that proud family tradition and launched another coup. For the next 100 years the dynasty would halt the decline of the Byzantine Empire under what we know as the Komnenian restoration. Ironically, the family would be toppled in a palace coup, but they would continue to rule as Emperors in Trebizond;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN7_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Plantagenet, who started off as a cadet branch of the elder house of Anjou. Geoffrey, the founder of the dynasty, was left with the family lands in France when his father went off to Jerusalem to become King. The Plantagenet family had a power base in France, and through marriages inherited the Kingdom of England and large parts of France. The French inheritance would lead to an ongoing conflict with France and the Hundred Years War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN8_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Estrid. Coming to the throne in Denmark in 1047, the house of Estrid was one of only two royal families to still hold kingdoms in 1337. Although there were several attempts at expansion, Denmark only gained small amount of land in Estonia, as most would be gained and then lost. The dynasty itself managed to survive and prosper in an era of chaos and turmoil, which is no mean feat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Welf, a dynasty very much down on its luck in 1066. By 1100 that had all changed. Control of two of the most powerful duchies in Germany and substantial lands in Italy made them the second most powerful family in Germany after the Hohenstaufen. One member of the Welf family would even gain the title of Emperor, but in the struggles would also weaken the family and much of the lands would be lost. The family would consolidate its holdings in Northern Germany as Dukes of Brunswick and remain a player in Imperial politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Genève, who were counts of Geneva in 1066. The house held this territory throughout the period and were still counts of Geneva in 1337. They never managed to climb any higher, but at the same time were able to cling onto their holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN12_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Zähringen, who were powerful landholders in Southern Germany and holders of the Duchies of Verona and Carinthia, which made the Zähringen family a key power holder in Germany. A failed rebellion against the Emperor saw these titles stripped from the family and other parts of the family lands would be inherited by other dynasties, leaving the family lands shrunk to a few holdings in Swabia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN13_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Montfort, who were small scale land holders in France. Through marriage and service the family gained estates in both Normandy and England. It was under the zealous but cruel Simon de Montfort the Elder that the family ascended. Through his participation in the Albigensian Crusade the family would add substantial estates in the South of France. The family reached the height of its power through his son Simon de Montfort the Younger, who became de facto ruler of England. However, all this would prove fleeting and by 1337 the family would have lost it all and gone extinct in the male line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DYN15_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Babenberger, which is not to be confused with the slightly more famous von Babenbergs of Austria. This cadet branch of house Capet held minor titles in Franconia. History probably wouldn't remember them if it wasn't for the more famous family with a similar name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
