DESC_renovatio_0001;The Spaniards of old were seemingly very far removed from the inhabitants of Spain today. It is said that all of Spain spoke in one tongue. That they wore exotic garments beyond the wildest dreams of even the Kings of today. Our finest scholars have reconstructed their language, and learned whatever they could of their traditions from the documents and relics that survive the Event. To claim legitimacy and assert our authority, we could adopt the culture of the ancient people. It will be inconvenient to drastically change the traditions of the entirety of the empire, so there is always the option of maintaining the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPT_A_renovatio_0001;Let us embrace the culture of the old world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
