landmark_basilica_of_propiciator;§YBasilica of the Propiciator§!\nThis newly built Basilica was erected by the Emperor of Yugoslavia to be the seat of the Propiciator of the Yugoslavist faith. The land around it, sparsely populated and located near the borders of mostly Sunni Bosnia Herzegovina, mostly Catholic Croatia and mostly Orthodox Serbia, was seen as perfect to show unity of the three faith, and was granted directly to the church to rule. However, the area has not improved much since, with the Propiciator merely organizing the expansion of the surrounding city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_base_of_the_tour_eiffel;§YBase of the Tour Eiffel§!\nFor a long time the Tour Eiffel was a symbol of Paris. After the Event, however, the great iron tower steadily deteriorated, until one of the rulers of Paris was forced to have it torn down to both scavenge the surviving material and make sure it wouldn't fall on the surrounding buildings. The base was however left, along with the four legs under request of most of the population. Since then, great effort has been put into preserving at least these last parts of the Tower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_big_ben;§YBig Ben§!\nThis great tower stands above the city of London since long before the Event, never falling in the face of time and weather. While the clock has long stopped moving, the building has been turned into a great watchtower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_black_gate;§YBlack Gate§!\nThe Black Gate is believed by the inhabitants of Trier to be the oldest building in all of Germany. It was of little fame outside of the region until the Battle of the Black Gate in 2530, when Trier managed to defeat against a Novelist host despite being pushed to the gate by the attack, marking a great victory for Christianity.

landmark_castel_del_monte;§YCastel del Monte§!\nThe octagonal plant of this remarkable piece of Pre-Event engeneering has puzzled men for centuries. Who built it, and why? This question may never have an answer, but nonetheless the Dukes of Puglia have settled long ago in the castle, turning it in their preferred residence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_colosseum;§YColosseum§!\nThe ancient Colosseum is a remnant of ages long past. A great arena similar to other found throughout Europe, the Colosseum is however said to have been where the greatest warriors would fight for the glory and honor of the Emperor.

landmark_gran_plaza_de_toros;Gran Plaza de Toros (Great Bullring)§!\nThe Gran Plaza de Toros of Pamplona is the most famous bullring in all of Iberia. The Basque Kings themselves visit yearly the city during the famous Encierro, the bull run where hundreds of people run from the best bulls in the country until reaching the great arena.

Other parts of Spain see the sport as barbaric compared to the Corrida, but the people of Pamplona defend it as a great proof of bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_hermannsdenkmal;§YHermannsdenkmal (Hermann's Monument)§!\nThis great monument is seen by many Germans as a symbol of victory over invaders.

Amongst those the most heavily respected by the people of Belgrade are the statue of the Victor, that celebrates the defeat of a great empire to the north, and the Broken Crown of Greece, a statue built to remember the defeat of the Hellenists by the first Emperor of Yugoslavia. Since the Fortress is only used as a place to store food in case of war, with newer building being used as residence for the Emperor or his main forces, access to the park is not restricted, and is one of the few places in Yugoslavia where nobels and commoners can come into contact, though this happens only rarely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

And die they did, with the final resistance ending with over three hundred of the finest Beneluxian warriors died around the cross rather than surrendering. However, the sight of the cross covered in blood and surrounded by the bodies of those honorable heroes was so magnificent and terrifying the Emperor of Numenor himself declared the Last Cross was to be left there, 2317 engraved on it to remember the year. It stands to this day, the only surviving cross in all of Benelux.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He will awake them from their tombs throughout Europe and summon them to battle once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_neuschwenstein;§YNeushcwenstein§!\nThe Great Castle of Neuschwenstein is the summer house of the rulers of the region, first Dukes and now Kings.

landmark_santiago_de_compostela;§YSantiago de Compostela§!\nThe legendary Tomb of Saint James has been for time immemorial the preferred pilgrimage site of Catholics from Europe and beyond.

landmark_valle_de_los_caidos;§YValle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen)§!\nThis monumental complex was built before the event by the Spanish rulers. It guards the corpses of the fallen in an ancient conflict lost in history, though many great generals and kings have been honored with being laid to rest here since the Kingdom of Castille was established. It is said a legendary Palmarian Saint, Francisco Caudillo, rests here, though the location of the burial site has been lost in the Event, along with many markings of the original builders.

landmark_wiener_staatsoper;§YWiener Staatsoper (Vienna State Opera)§!\nWhile many things have been lost since the Event, the people of Vienna still talk of when their city was called the City of Music and Dreams.

The theater is the set of yearly celebrations where the best poets are invited to partecipate, singing to all that may want to listen. For the rest of the year, only nobles are allowed in the opera house, to observe the exhibitions of court poets from all of Germany, unless the rulers of Austria decide to open it to the people of Vienna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
