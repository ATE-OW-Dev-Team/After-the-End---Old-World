ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664043;Long ages have passed since a single ruler has controlled all of Germany. Where once stood a single Emperor, now domains rise and fall in a night, all dreaming to rule once again over all the Germans. Between the 24th and 25th Century, the Zollerns expanded their control over various neighbouring states. Then, Prussia looked east, to restore it's rule on the land that they considered theirs. The invasion of Poland and the northern states seemed a success at first, until in 2430 the Prussians came to the walls of the Republic of Danzig. Here, against all odds, the army of the Republic and the mercenary bands they hired fought valiantly, managing not only to defeat the Prussian army, but also to capture the King himself. Thus, the war ended, and so did the dreams of conquest of the Prussians. Now, Prussia is only a shadow of it's former self, and none has ever brought back the Prussian Kingdom to it's former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664161;Switzerland has gained much since the Event. The Calvinist church has become the country's national church, and many claim that the great conquest in formerly French lands is proof of the benevolence of God. Controlling vast territories in France and some in Northern Italy, Switzerland is currently the most powerful German Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661219;Meanwhile, in Grand Est, it is Erik Leroux, the deformed King of Grand Est, that controls the border between the powerful Luxembourgish and the marches of Borbon, lands ruled by small rulers. King Erik, however, has no heirs for his kingdom, who may instead pass to his vassals if his wife, the beautiful swedish queen he has chosen, does not give him a heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661100;After the Event, the British Isles have seen a great deal of transformations. The followers of the faith of Thelema, before a minority, raised slowly but steadily in power, thanks to a fall in the old beliefs. Meanwhile, the population too saw a change, with Welsh speaking people gaining an unheard off population advantage over the English speakers.There is and will always be only one ruler of Britannia, the immortal Queen. But, until she decides it is time to come back to her throne, it is the Lord Protector that has to hold it for her. And house Cyflymarian, whose current leader is Lord Protector Freddie, has proven more than capable, expanding the rule of Her Immortal Majesty from Faroya to Thouars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661202;Outside of the borders of the British Empire, stands the King of Pas de Calais, Aragorn Bonaparte. Along with his loyal vassal, this man has fought against the British for centuries. Yet, he and his sons Faramir, Boromir and Arathorn, along with his vassals, have great projects for the future of the kingdom... and of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661300;Once the first Empire after the Event, Benelux fragmented after the death of the last Emperor in three kingdoms: Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg. Now minor kings in the great scheme of things, they however are still well respected in the region, and their family, House Belgium-Orange-Nassau-Weilburg, is still a respected and feared name. And yet, each of them has to face one danger.Luxembourg, ruled by King Philippe, is a warring states, in eternal conflict with the Swiss to the south, Grand Est to the West and Belgium to the north. For while Luxembourg conquered his new lands a long time ago, many still consider them nothing more than invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26660515;At one point, Castille was close to restore ancient Spain, ruling over Galicia and the Asturias and all it's de jure land. Then, under a tyrant king, it lost more and more land, ending with Galicia y Asturias and Extremadura seceding. After a century of losing land to Andalusia and Catalonia, can the Palmarian King retake the lands he once ruled?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664006;When the force of the Hellenists in Greece invaded the northern countries, the six great kings of the Balkans - Bosnia, Slovenia, Croazia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Albania - joined forces under a new faith, to unite their armies in spirit as well as strength, and repelled the invader. Thus was born the Empire of Yugoslavia, with the Emperor elected among the royal families by his peers. Even after the death of the last Albanian King, his dukes still are candidates to succeed the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664016;Greece was once the main power in the Balkans. Under the rule of the Olimpian Kings, the Greeks rediscovered the ancient ways of the Hellenists faiths, and built their power over their ancient lands. And yet, after their defeat against the Empire, they were forced to give up their land and their freedom, turning into tributaries of the Emperor. Can they free themselves, or is the Hellenic faith destined to disappear from the Balkans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26669125;Those Zarists who favoured holding Stalin in high honor rather than contempt came to be known as the Stalinists. Stalinists are strict monotheists, worshipping Lord Stalin to the exclusion of all others. They believe that he still fights to defend them and Russia from their enemies – and their enemies are many.Eventually, as the Zarist faith became more codified, the contempt many felt for the Stalinists turned to naked hostility, and finally violence.Pursued by constant aggression, the Stalinists were driven south, escaping into the untamed wilds of West Kazakhstan and the Caspian Coast. By the 26th century, all the squabbling Stalinist tribes have been united under one leader: the great Genndy Zyuganov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664146;Far beyond the civilised lands of Central Russia, beyond the banks of the sacred river Volga, the authority of the Tzar does not extend. These lands are wild, untamed, populated by hard men and barbarism.The majority religion in this area lacks a single unified name, but has come to be called ‘Folklorism’ by the scholars of Moskva. Folklorism is a disorganised pagan belief system that has no essential doctrines, but a number of beliefs are common among them. The central deity of their pantheon is Mother Russia, the great goddess and protectress of Russia. In ancient days she and her children conquered everything between the Black Sea and the White Sea, and her children, the Rus, were well protected and happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
