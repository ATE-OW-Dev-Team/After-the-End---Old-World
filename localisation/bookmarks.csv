ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664043;Long ages have passed since a single ruler has controlled all of Germany. Where once stood a single Emperor, now domains rise and fall in a night, all dreaming to rule once again over all the Germans. Between the 24th and 25th Century, the Zollerns expanded their control over various neighbouring states. Then, Prussia looked east, to restore it's rule on the land that they considered theirs. The invasion of Poland and the northern states seemed a success at first, until in 2430 the Prussians came to the walls of the Republic of Danzig. Here, against all odds, the army of the Republic and the mercenary bands they hired fought valiantly, managing not only to defeat the Prussian army, but also to capture the King himself. Thus, the war ended, and so did the dreams of conquest of the Prussians. Now, Prussia is only a shadow of it's former self, and none has ever brought back the Prussian Kingdom to it's former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664161;Switzerland has gained much since the Event. The Calvinist church has become the country's national church, and many claim that the great conquest in formerly French lands is proof of the benevolence of God. Controlling vast territories in France and some in Northern Italy, Switzerland is currently the most powerful German Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661219;Meanwhile, in Grand Est, it is Erik Leroux, the deformed King of Grand Est, that controls the border between the powerful Luxembourgish and the marches of Borbon, lands ruled by small rulers. King Erik, however, has no heirs for his kingdom, who may instead pass to his vassals if his wife, the beautiful swedish queen he has chosen, does not give him a heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661100;After the Event, the British Isles have seen a great deal of transformations. The followers of the faith of Thelema, before a minority, raised slowly but steadily in power, thanks to a fall in the old beliefs. Meanwhile, the population too saw a change, with Welsh speaking people gaining an unheard off population advantage over the English speakers.There is and will always be only one ruler of Britannia, the immortal Queen. But, until she decides it is time to come back to her throne, it is the Lord Protector that has to hold it for her. And house Cyflymarian, whose current leader is Lord Protector Freddie, has proven more than capable, expanding the rule of Her Immortal Majesty from Faroya to Thouars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661202;Outside of the borders of the British Empire, stands the King of Pas de Calais, Aragorn Bonaparte. Along with his loyal vassal, this man has fought against the British for centuries. Yet, he and his sons Faramir, Boromir and Arathorn, along with his vassals, have great projects for the future of the kingdom... and of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26661300;Once the first Empire after the Event, Benelux fragmented after the death of the last Emperor in three kingdoms: Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg. Now minor kings in the great scheme of things, they however are still well respected in the region, and their family, House Belgium-Orange-Nassau-Weilburg, is still a respected and feared name. And yet, each of them has to face one danger.Luxembourg, ruled by King Philippe, is a warring states, in eternal conflict with the Swiss to the south, Grand Est to the West and Belgium to the north. For while Luxembourg conquered his new lands a long time ago, many still consider them nothing more than invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26660515;At one point, Castille was close to restore ancient Spain, ruling over Galicia and the Asturias and all it's de jure land. Then, under a tyrant king, it lost more and more land, ending with Galicia y Asturias and Extremadura seceding. After a century of losing land to Andalusia and Catalonia, can the Palmarian King retake the lands he once ruled?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664006;When the force of the Hellenists in Greece invaded the northern countries, the six great kings of the Balkans - Bosnia, Slovenia, Croazia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Albania united their armies in spirit as well as strength, and repelled the invader. Thus was born the Empire of Yugoslavia, with the Emperor elected among the royal families by his peers. Even after the death of the last Albanian King, his dukes still are candidates to succeed the Emperor. But that was hundreds of years ago. Now, as old conflicts started to emerge again, Yugoslavia might be destined to fall to petty squabbles. The previous Car of Yugoslavia, in a last ditch effort created Yugoslavism, a compromise faith incorporating elements of all balkan religions. While still weak and rarely practiced outside the nobility, it is a chance for peace in the Balkans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664016;Greece was once the main power in the Balkans. Under the rule of the Olimpian Kings, the Greeks rediscovered the ancient ways of the Hellenists faiths, and built their power over their ancient lands. And yet, after their defeat against the Empire, they were forced to give up their land and their freedom, turning into tributaries of the Emperor. Can they free themselves, or is the Hellenic faith destined to disappear from the Balkans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26669125;Those Zarists who favoured holding Stalin in high honor rather than contempt came to be known as the Stalinists. Stalinists are strict monotheists, worshipping Lord Stalin to the exclusion of all others. They believe that he still fights to defend them and Russia from their enemies – and their enemies are many.Eventually, as the Zarist faith became more codified, the contempt many felt for the Stalinists turned to naked hostility, and finally violence.Pursued by constant aggression, the Stalinists were driven south, escaping into the untamed wilds of West Kazakhstan and the Caspian Coast. By the 26th century, all the squabbling Stalinist tribes have been united under one leader: the great Genndy Zyuganov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664146;Far beyond the civilised lands of Central Russia, beyond the banks of the sacred river Volga, the authority of the Tzar does not extend. These lands are wild, untamed, populated by hard men and barbarism.The majority religion in this area lacks a single unified name, but has come to be called ‘Folklorism’ by the scholars of Moskva. Folklorism is a disorganised pagan belief system that has no essential doctrines, but a number of beliefs are common among them. The central deity of their pantheon is Mother Russia, the great goddess and protectress of Russia. In ancient days she and her children conquered everything between the Black Sea and the White Sea, and her children, the Rus, were well protected and happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664081;Lithuania, and really all of the Baltic states, after the fall broke up in many warring states. While Belarus remained divided in mostly Orthodox duchies, the faith of Romuva became the majority throughout the Baltic. However, that is not to say the Christians were defeated. And sure enough, eventually the Catholics united under a single, charismatic ruler. This man, a warrior and diplomat of rare talent, managed to convince the Orthodox and the Lutheran to fight by his side, and reclaim the land from the pagans. What followed was an harsh, bloody war, with no quarter given or expected by either side. And in the end, the cross was triumphant. The Romuva faith is now only a memory, with no land and no lord still practicing it. The King of Lithuania, is now the major power of the region. And now, weather Lithuania is destined to thrive or die, is up to the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26669000;There is no tale of rise and decline in the world after the Event that quite compares to the rise and fall of Transnistria. Once a small border region between Moldova and Ucraine, after the Event the region grew more and more in power. At it's apex, all from Romania to Donkuban had to bend the knee to the great emperors of the Dniester. However, as time passed, civil wars grew in size, as ambitious brothers and vassals clashed with Emperor after Emperor time and time again. The first to leave the Empire was the King of Romania, and after him, the Cossaks of Donkuban followed. Lastly, it was the region beyond the river Dnieper, from Pereyaslavl to Crimea, that fell out of the Empire's grasp. The Emperor still formally controls all those land, although in reality the King of Ukraine, one of his last vassals, is growing to such power he may soon break free as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;xv


ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672002;The north-western part of India has always been a place of many faiths, and the Event did little to change that. The region is dominated by two primary powers – in the North, Maharaja Raavi Singh rules over the ancestral holy land of the Sikh people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672009;The largest Kingdom of ancient India, Uttar Pradesh is the fertile heartland of Indic civilisation. The Gangetic floodplain supports agriculture strong enough to feed millions, though nothing like the surely-mythical yields that are said to have been possible to the pre-Event civilisation. The terrain and high populations of the region have resulted in much conflict, which has finally resolved itself in the form of three ruling dynasties; the Mishras, the Guptas, and the Anands. The conflict has grown ever more intense with the interference of the Nepali kingdom, whose Buddhist rulers find it prudent to keep their southern neighbours eternally feuding with each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672007;The Guptas were once minor landholders in Delhi, but rose to power in a coup against a King seen as weak and corrupt. Known adherents of the extremist Barata Ganda school, they set out to purge India from what they viewed as ‘impure’ influences. This was followed by a horrific campaign of persecution and violence against Muslim minorities within the Guptas’ realm. This earned them the especial ire of the Mishras, who were famous for their protection and even patronage of Muslims within their own lands, even the unorthodox and highly persecuted Ahmadiyya. Believers in the Vaishna Ganda school, they were firm believers in freedom of religion, and were disgusted that the Guptas could be so blasphemous as to slaughter Muslims in the name of the Mahatma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26672031;The geography of the Deccan Plateau makes it difficult for outsiders to exert control over the region, but also makes it troublesome for rulers to expand beyond its borders. In 2555, most of Deccan has been unified underneath the Purandara Empire, a large and relatively stable realm that is ringed on all sides by smaller coastal powers. However, despite its size, the Empire is in a perilous position – the previous Emperor died young, with his one-year-old son his only heir. A regent rules the realm for now, but powerful and ambitious vassals vie for power, threatening to destabilise the Deccan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_266611108;All had changed a few decades ago A party of foreign ships, looking rather ragged and their crews worse for wear, took refuge in the western port of Mumbai, where their pale complexions and outlandish clothing stirred up a storm of curiosity about them. It soon became clear that they desired to purchase land in India, which quickly earned the ire of the locals, but mere days later a larger fleet appeared on the horizon. However, the Desai Maharaja had not ignored the threat, and the foreign fleet turned away and sailed south. However, the Purandara Empire made it impossible for them to make any serious attempt at landing in southern India. At last, having circled around almost the whole subcontinent, they made landfall in Kolkata. The new rulers announced their loyalty to the Great Queen, who had conquered this land ages ago, and for whose glory they were to reclaim it. The British had come again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664259;The ancient Kingdom of Egypt dates back not to before the Event, but many say even sooner, to the very beginning of time. Today, however, it is gone, divided in warring states. The many Sunni Sheiks and the Copts of Asyut fight for supremacy on the lower course of the Nile, attempting to reform the lost kingdom.As one follows the Nile south, he enters Sudan. This domain extends over a great part of the western coast, and is in fact the greatest in size, if not in power. The Sudanese King John Dawoud rules his followers with a just but strict discipline. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664192;A traveler that sets foot west of Alodia enters the domain of the Kings of Chad. This Kingdom takes it’s name from the great Lake Chad, that gives them all the water so rarely found in the Desert to their north. This makes them, of course, prime targets of the nomads of Air, but so far, the armies of Chad have resisted their invasions and fought off their raids. The rulers of Chad, including current Sultan Adergazuz Dabadi, do not follow the Sunni faith, but the Sufi. Once just a name for a mystical school of thought, Sufi became after the Event a full fledged faith, divided in various sects that incorporate vastly different mystical teachings, from those that incorporate African Paganism to those who seek to ‘purify’ Islam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664220;From Morocco to Cyrenaica, from the Atlas Mountains to the great deserts of Lybia, spans the Barbary Coast. The great nations of old ruled this vast Mediterranean coast, but now only one of them still exists. Morocco survives, the great Kingdom of the Atlas. This Sunni land is however ruled by King Hassan Alaouite, a follower of the Maliki faith. This Muslim religion is centered around the role of the Alouite family, who they claim has the sole right to Caliphate, putting them at odds with the majority of their populace, who follow the Sunni creed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664193;The Sahara Desert is a harsh wasteland where no great kingdom can sprout. Instead, various tribes of nomadic people fight for control on the region and of the trade from the southern kingdoms to the northern ones. From Bir um Grein to Mokhtar, Tuareg, Barbariyya and Toubu clans fight for control of the desert roads. Those nomadic clans tend to disappear and get overturned by their internal feuds, only to follow a new leader in raids both to other clans and outside of the desert, where they are equally respected and feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664228;The Occitan adventurer Pierre Gericault fled the growing power of Edmond Dantés, and with his few retainers fled to Algeria, where legends tell of a long gone Kingdom ruled by the French. Here, he has conquered a vast swath of land. But still, he borders many, many dangerous enemies that find him and his faith equally unpleasing. Only time will tell if this young domain will survive or wither and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26664258;Even more to the south are the divided lands that once formed fabled domains like Sudan of the South, Ethiopia, Erithrea and Somalia. Those vast lands are ruled now by Dukes of various caliber, trying to ascend to equal stand to Sudan and Chad, and by the merchant republic of old Djibouti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_26662801;Israel, the homeland of Judaism, has managed to survive post Event thanks to two advantage: the control of the ports of the Mediterranean, which gave it great richness, and the rule over the great fortresses of Acre and Jerusalem. Those forts managed to defend the borders of the Kingdom through the hardest post-event wars, holding their most important Holy Sites. However, this changed recently. The fall of Acre caused great concern in the kingdom, with many fearing a third diaspora may soon fall on them. Some have even already left, founding colonies all over the Mediterranean, even though they have all since been incorporated into other kingdoms. While David Yaakov, current King of Israel, has proved to be a great military ruler, as his win against all odds against the Sauds shows, and has many sons to ensure the survival of his dynasty, it may not be enough for his country to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26670006;The lands of Mesopotamia where once the cradle of civilization, the heart of Empires and nations unlike any on Earth. And before the Event, many had tried to claim back at least part of that legacy, to claim back the heritage of Babilon, the Assyrians and great Ur. It took the Event to see one of those give fruit. A warlord named Mubarak, a fool to many, a weird man to most, one day in his youth stumbled in what he simply described as “great ruins containing books unlike any I have ever read”. It was a collection of myths and histories on the ancient world, and on the rule of legendary kings like Gilgamesh, Nabuchadnezzar, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Hussain. With those revelations, he begun to craft the new faith. Mesopotamianism, as he called it, follows the teachings of those great Kings and many of those of Islam. And in the following decades, with sword and diplomacy, Emir Mubarak expanded his influence, founding the Mubarakid Emirate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_26670003;The Sauds ruled Arabia before the event, and after it, after a brief age of chaos, they came back again to reclaim their throne. Ruling from the Persian Gulf, they slowly rebuilt their country, ultimately entering Mecca and Medina. However, if they could unify their old country, they were unable to reclaim absolute authority over it’s faith. Wahhabism remained the dominating faith of the family and their lands, and the Nefoud tribes accepted it, but the western coast, including Mecca and Medina, remained strongly Sunni. In recent years, however, the situation has changed dramatically. It all began with the fall of the last Saud Sultan in battle against Israel. With his death and defeat, the throne passed to his eldest son, Muhammad. However, Muhammad is Sunni, not Wahhabi. He converted at young age, and has been a zealous believer since. Many claim it was the Sultan’s intention to disinherit him, but his death came before he could do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
