EVTDESCJB1;For centuries, an ancient belief system has existed in Europe, though it has usually existed underground in small cabals or among the heights of academia. These people, called 'The Jacobins', believe firmly that the Event was caused by Europe's loss of fervour in the worship of the great goddess, Madame Guillotine. Following the teachings of the Prophet Robespierre, they hold that Madame Guillotine must constantly be sated with fresh blood, lest mankind be punished with a second Event. For most of their existence they have been persecuted for their insane and dangerous beliefs, but in recent days a charismatic young preacher has managed to convince many that the Second Event is nigh, and that dramatic action is necessary to avert the End. Hidden Jacobinists have arisen from their caves to aid him, bolstered by an army of peasants drawn by his apparent mystical powers and charismatic preaching. They now seek to war against the whole world, in order to save it.;;;;;;;;;x
