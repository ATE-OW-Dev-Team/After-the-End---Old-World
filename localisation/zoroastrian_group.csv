cancel_search_for_the_reincarnation_of_god_desc;Searching for the reincarnation of Xwede is costly, both money- and timewise. It might be better to leave it for a later time. However, all the current progress will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1001;Due to your current circumstances, you can't continue the search for the reincarnation of Xwede.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1001;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZOR_1006;There has been a major setback in the search for the reincarnation of Xwede.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1010;You got some new information about some possible sources which can help you to find the reincarnation of Xwede. Unfortunately, they are located on lands of infidels. Your chancellor warns you that it can end in a diplomatic disaster...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1010;I take any risks.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1010;Best to keep calm.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1011;You asked yourself how you could examine as many boys as possible if they are the reincarnation of Xwede. The answer is simple, all new soldiers could be examined. However, this would greatly slow down the recruitment...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1011;Wars are secondary now.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1011;I can't afford this.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1012;Today, you looked for an ancient building which could help you in the search for the reincarnation of Xwede. To your surprise, it was demolished to build a new house on its place. You realised that all constructions could seriously damage the process of your search.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1012;Every construction will need my personal approval.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1012;That's the price we pay for civilization.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1013;Until this time, you were kind to the peasants. You asked them if they knew anything about the reincarnation of Xwede, and they answered. But you suspect many of those who denied that they knew anything actually didn't tell the truth.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1013;They will speak.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1013;I should trust them.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1014;While members of the church supports your search for the reincarnation of Xwede, they still withhold some sacred texts from you. Without those you may never find anything. You could force clergy to give access to the texts but they certainly won't be delighted about this.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ZOR_1014;I can find sources elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1015;You spent day and night searching for the reincarnation of Xwede with no result. You might need to take a rest for a couple of days and continue.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1015;This work can't wait.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1015;Something drives me from the inside.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZOR_1015;That will be the best.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1050;You finally found the place where the reincarnation of Xwede could be. You rush up the old stairs and open the door to the tower room. Sadly, there is no tower room.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1050;AAAHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ZOR_1051;After years of work, you need to conclude that you got nowhere. You will never find the reincarnation of Xwede.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1051;Only if I worked harder.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1051;I'm a failure.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZOR_1051;This all doesn't make sense.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ZOR_1061;It's now clear that you were not chosen to find the reincarnation of Xwede. However, you learnt a lot during the search.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ZOR_1061;I can serve Him in other ways.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ZOR_1061;I learnt the joys of hard work.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ZOR_1061;I'm nothing but a mere human being.;;;;;;;;;;x
