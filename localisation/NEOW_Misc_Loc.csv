###NOBELIAN EVENTS###,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian1Desc;The secrets of the ancients are many and deep. Plumbing their mystic depths is very difficult even for the most dedicated scholar. Yet, if I ever wish to be counted among the wisest scholars, I must delve nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_nobelian1;I will search for a mentor to help me.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_nobelian1;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_nobelian1;My mentor will aid me on the difficult path.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian2Desc;You have discovered a mystical scholar belonging to a small monastic order, who would be of use to you in your studies. However, the Order is reluctant to let them go, for their loss would be a significant blow to the community.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_nobelian2;I'll pay his weight in gold!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_nobelian2;I'm sure I can persuade them to part;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC_nobelian2;How can the Order refuse one of such august blood as I?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTD_nobelian2;On second thought, this isn't worth THAT much to me.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTB_nobelian3;Are you insane?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian4Desc;My search party has returned with a skilled scholar-mystic. However, the price they are asking is? rather extreme. They seem to demand a piece of my own flesh to serve me.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTA_nobelian7;Help Me!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobelian8Desc;As you prepare to enter the sacred sauna, your Mentor stops you.

nobelian18Desc;You set out to write down your Mystical Experiences and lay them forth in an orderly manner. While they may be gratifying to you personally, if they remain only within your own head, they are unlikely to help anyone else.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He bids you swiftly to wake and inscribe it down, before your memory fades. You are jarred awake and sit bolt upright, practically jumping out of bed. Motes of the dream escape from your memory practically every second, but you immediately write down as much of what you were told as you can remember. When it is done, you have before you the text of a great revelation - a piece, however incomplete, of the great truths known by God.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAMEJOJO9;Assassin Attack!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
##Jojo Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO1;The Phantom of Blood;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO1;You are Jonathan Joestar, only son of the noble George. When you were very young, a commoner saved your father's life, and in gratitude your father raised that man's son as his own. This was your adoptive brother, Dio Brando. Yet Dio did not show gratitude to his benefactor, but instead plotted to torment you and usurp your own life, even trying to poison your father and blame you for the crime! You recently discovered his duplicity and, with the aid of your new friend Robert Speedwagon, confronted him. He managed to escape, despite having been shot seemingly-fatally by crossbow bolts. Now, he has taken control of the small castle known as Knight's Lot, and is plotting some new nefarious scheme. You must stop Dio before he ruins any more lives!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.1;I'll make you cry like a baby, Dio!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO2;The End;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO2;After storming Dio's castle, you find your wicked half-brother gloating there," mocking you. "You're too late"," Jojo!" he says. "I've already thrown away my humanity! Now I will live forever!" Unfazed", you draw your sword and swing mightily, cleaving a deep blow through his head! You've won! But then, to your shock," Dio begins to laugh. "Didn't I already tell you that I am no longer human?" To your amazement", he begins to push the two halves of his severed head back together, and they begin to heal! He grabs hold of you, and you begin to feel your strength draining out of you! Thinking quickly, you push forward, towards the edge of the high castle parapet that you are dueling on. Before he realises what is happening, you both tumble off, into the night. With your free hand, you grab onto a protruding tree branch, arresting your fall. Dio, his grip loosened by shock, plummets past you, screaming curses of eternal vengenace.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_jojo.2;Goodbye, Dio;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO3;Jonathan has defeated you. Sunken deep into the ocean, you barely manage to survive by locking yourself inside a coffin. You will have to remain here, drifting at the mercy of the waves, until someone happens upon your sunken tomb. Until then, all you can do is wait, and brood.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.3;One day I will extinguish the Joestar bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO4;A Joyful Victory;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO4;Victory! With your triumph over your wicked half-brother Dio, you have avenged the death of your father and the Joestar family name. At last, you may have some peace and quiet, as is your reward. But what could Dio have meant when he said he was no longer human? Could he truly be still alive?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.4;If he ever returns, the Joestars will be ready.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO5;Stardust Crusaders;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO5;At last, the time has come. An African fisherman has fished up your floating coffin, and opened it. After swiftly killing him and his companions, you stretch out your body, stiff beyond measure after a century of confinement. Throughout the years, one thought alone has kept you sane - revenge on the Joestar bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTAJOJO5;Do you believe in Gravity?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO6;The Memory of Your Bloodline;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO6;Out of nowhere, you feel a sudden chill, as if your whole body were suddenly blasted by a harsh winter wind. You ask the members of your family, and they also report that the same thing happened to them at the same time. Nobody else in your court was affected, only your family members. What could this ominous feeling mean?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.6;This dread runs in my very veins...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO9;Assassin Attack!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO9;It has been several months now since you felt that strange chill in your blood, and you had forgotten all about it. One day, while getting dressed, you notice one of the servants enter the room. You asked them to help you, but to your surprise, they drew a weapon on you! "Hail, Lord DIO! I do this for you!";;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.9;Fight back!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_jojo.9;Trick them!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO10;The End;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO10;You struggle valiantly, but the assassin gets the better of you. As you feel the blade sink into your chest, you wonder why all of this had to happen...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.10;No...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO11;Reprieve;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO11;After a desperate struggle, you manage to throw off your attacker. Your guards arrive at last, and quickly dispose of the assassin.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.11;Thank goodness;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO12;Call To Adventure;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO12;The assassin's body has been disposed of, and normalcy is finally starting to return to the household. After several hours, a servant arrives, bearing an important message. He introduces you to a strange man that you don't recognise. \n "You don't know me, but I know you" he says. "Your ancestor, Jonathan Joestar, killed Dio Brando. But DIO was no longer mortal, he was something...different. After a hundred years, he has returned, and now his fanatical followers seek to exterminate you and everyone else who carries the Joestar blood. I can take you to DIO. This will never end until he is dead, but I will understand if you don't want to take the risk.";;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.12;I will finish Jonathan's work!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB_jojo.12;This is too dangerous. Let someone else do it!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO13;An Adventure Most Menacing;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO13;After a harrowing journey, you finally arrive at DIO's mansion in uptown Cairo. The place is filled with a dreadful, terrifying aura, and every step through it is filled with peril. At last, however, you find yourself at the base of a grand golden staircase. At the top, a huge, muscular figure looms in the shadows. \n "Oh, you're approaching me?" he says. You swallow your fear and respond. "I can't kill you without getting closer." He laughs. \n "Oho! Then come as close as you like!";;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.13;This is your end, DIO!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO14;In DIO's World;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO14;DIO's movements are incredibly quick, he seems to appear and disappear with blinding speed. You only have a moment to attack!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.14;One chance is all I need!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO15;End of the World;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO15;In a split second, you see DIO leave a weak point open! You swing with all your might, and your blade strikes true! It bites deep into DIO's leg, causing him to stumble. "I-Impossible!" he cries. "I AM DIO!" You heave mightily, cleaving his entire leg in twain, before pulling your sword back and cutting his head clean off. With his leg crippled, he is unable to block. Strange black fluid pours out of his body, as the ageless DIO finally crumbles. You have finished Jonathan's work, and saved your entire bloodline.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA_jojo.15;At last, it's over;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAMEJOJO16;Useless, Useless, Useless;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESCJOJO16;You try to swing, but before you can so much as blink, DIO vanishes from your sight. He reappears behind you, and strikes you so hard that you are impaled through the chest by his arm. "Disappointing. I had hoped the Joestar bloodline would prove more of a challenge." Things go black as you collapse to the floor...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sikh1Desc;You dress yourself in the five Sikh articles of faith, The five Pyare, wise men representing the 'beloved volunteers' who bravely followed the Guru into his tent when he created the way of the Khalsa, surround you and explain the meaning of following the Khalsa. You must swear never again to cut your hair, to eat the meat of any animal, to cohabit with anyone other than your spouse, or to use tobacco, alcohol, or any kind of drug. You swear to follow these stipulations throughout all of your life, and a sixth Sikh reads a randomly-chosen passage from the Guru Grant Sahib. You repeat the sacred salutation, and the Pyare mix pure water in an iron bowl using a ceremonial sword. You drink from the bowl, and are fully inducted into the Khalsa.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

These are the stories of our great ancestors, who descended from the stars and had built the God-Like empire of Daaria in the far north, and it is said that for them one year equated to merely one day. Their descendants unified Asia under the thumb of Asgard, or Arkaim, the throne of Gardaria and created Tartary, empire of Tripillians.

bhutanese_restored_government_desc;This nation is highly advanced and ordered, with bureaucratic structures and technologies that preserve some of the marvels of the antediluvian world.

bhutan_martial_reform_desc;The Dragon Army hasn't had to fight a serious war in centuries, confining itself to minor skirmishes, border patrol, and occasional tributary wars against vastly inferior forces. It has become complacent, nepotism is rampant, and the position of officer is seen as a cushy job rather than a serious calling to sacrifice for one's country.

bhutan3Desc;Since time out of mind, the small mountain nation of Bhutan has reigned stable and steadfast, seemingly immune to the storms and tribulations of the world. Legends state that even the Event barely touched them, and that much of the wisdom of the Old World is preserved in the great Catacombs beneath Bumthang. To the people of Tibet and India, the Thunder Dragon Empire is simply like the ground beneath a man's feet - he rarely notices it, but he could not imagine it ceasing to exist. \nHowever, long centuries of peace had made the Bhutanese complacent. Their tax system grew inefficient, their scholars ceased to learn anything new, and their army grew rife with nepotism and laziness. That has all changed, however. Over the past few decades, the Emperors have gradually managed to reform their country's ageing systems, and now they have completed their work. With their country once again revitalised, the Thunder Dragon may yet again spread its wings across Eastern Asia...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bhutan5Desc;Bhutan's bureacratic system is highly efficient at administrating land - specifically, the land within Bhutan itself, which they've gotten so used to dealing with that it's often joked that the bureacrats could do their jobs while asleep. Unfortunately, we've found ourselves in possession of land outside of those familiar schema, and they're having a bit of trouble with it. In fact, they are proving frankly incompetent at managing it, and have bungled it horribly. Now the peasants are angry, the taxes aren't being collected, and many within the Empire are starting to wonder if taking this land was worth it in the first place.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTTITLENOBEL39;Dreams of Dismal Moonlight;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
nobelian39Desc;In your dreams tonight, a moth stirs, and lights upon your ear. It whispers, in a voice of satin and dark ice: "The Truth awaits you in the NORTH". An inexplicable feeling washes over you, and you gaze upward at the moon, and the moon looks back at you, and the moon's light reveals to you a hint, a scrap, a breadcrumb of knowledge, like the last snowflake on the grass at springtide. It says: \nDo not listen to him. That way is closed to all those who are mortal.";;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

There is a bitter, cold wind, and in the thunderous roar of midwinter silence, the voice returns to you. \n\n "Gild yourself" it says "for the key of the Gate of Treasons is the idolatry of the heart." A figure emerges from the Gate - a statue, a golden idol, embedded with gems, made in your own image. The voice says "Will you open the Gate?";;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

It will not let me pass, for my ancient crime, but you may, if you will destroy something of priceless value, something posterity will condemn you for.";;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

String_ThirdGatePassed;Once again, you approach the Corpusculent Sarcophage, but this time it is different. He no longer looks at you with hunger, but with disgust.

Is this your first time in the House of Lies? Yes? No? Oh well, it doesn't really matter either way." \n\nHe produces a silver knife, and gestures to you to open your mouth. \n\n"Come, now.

"What are you doing in the War Room? Get back on the front lines, grunt!"Before you know what has happened, you find yourself dressed in a blue uniform, charging into battle.

But...what is this? Before you, you see a...is that a sheet? A piece of paper? You look, and are shocked to see your own face. Above it, it says "[Root.GetTitledNameWithNick]". What?

EVTTITLEromuva6;Resurgence of the Romuva;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
romuva6Desc;Over two centuries ago, Paulius Juze, a fervent and zealous Catholic knight, led a Crusade that ended in the overthrow of the pagan Mindaugasid kings of Lithuania. He and his descendants strongly suppressed paganism, and it nearly died out in its own country. Recently, however, [k_lithuania.Holder.GetTitledName] has reverted to the Old Faith, and as he has proved a strong ruler, he has proclaimed a new era for the old religion. Throughout the country, isolated enclaves of pagans are emerging from their caves, and enthusiasm for the religion is at an all-time high. Though the Catholics despise [k_lithuania.Holder.GetHerHim] for this, for the moment they cannot do anything about it. It remains to be seen if this return will last, or if this pagan monarch will meet the same fate as the last one.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
