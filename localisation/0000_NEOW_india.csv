indian_feudal_desc;The event resulted in a collapse of the central government's authority in the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, the remnants of the government managed to survive the event in isolated regions, and soon became much more feudal in structure, with ministers effectively having the power of monarchs. It is primarily focused around moving power upwards to the ducal, kingly and imperial levels by treating the lowest of vassals in a manner more akin to regional governors than true feudal vassals. Compared to feudal states, the ruler is somewhat restricted by the rule of law when dealing with their vassals.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

old_hindu;Old Hindu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
old_hindu_DESC;Hinduism is a blanket term for a variety of related traditions and practices found in the Indian subcontinent, with a history going back millenia before the event. Post-event hindus worship various dieties, or 'Devas' out of which Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, and Shakti used to be prominent, but local and minor gods have increased in importance over time, and the goddess Lakshmi has seen an especial increase in importance. Gandhi began to be revered as a god, while worship of Brahma was dropped altogether. Adherents of the faith hold that the event was caused by the god Kalki, an incarnation of Vishnu, who destroyed the world because of its impious and decadent ways. The religion is based on a collection of religious scriptures known as a Vedas, as well as various other post-vedic texts and a few post-event ones. They also believe that they reincarnate after death. A prominent aspect of the religion is adherence to the varna system, where society is divided into castes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
maunaxite;Dharmic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
maunaxite_DESC;Not so much a faith as a blanket term for various disorganized cults and practices across eastern India. Adherents show no hesitation in raiding or even invading realms of heathen rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maunaxite_reformed;Mahadharmic;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maunaxite_reformed_DESC;The Mahadharma represents a reformation and organization of the Dharmic Cults of eastern India, adding a priestly hierarchy and formalised texts, enabling it to more effectively resist the encroachment of other faiths. They principally believe that the event was caused by the rulers of the world growing too corrupt and thus Kalki struck down the Proud mankind as punishment for their corruption.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,;
neovedantic;Neo-Vedantic;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neovedantic_DESC;Neo-Vedanticism is a Hindu school of thought that advocates for the rejection of the Varna system and abhors discrimination on the basis of social class. They consider themselves the successors of a pre-event movement, while other Dharmics think they emerged some time after the event. The word 'Neo-Vedantic' was originally used by their opponents to disparage them, with the implication that they represented a break from tradition and hence were not authentically hindu. Neovedantics also differ in another crucial aspect: They consider Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva as the three most important deities of hinduism (The Trimurti), while other devas are relegated to a more minor role. Kubera, the god of wealth, has been elevated in status by neovedantics, and is widely worshipped by many of them.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist;Bhagavanist;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
parabrahmanist_DESC;The Bhagavanist religion came to dominate many parts of India in the chaos following the Event. Like pre-Event Hindus, they venerate various gods, but they view all gods as aspects of "Bhagavan", and it is from this distinctive idea that the sect gains their name. Bhagavanists believe that certain great rulers of the past also worshipped Bhagavan, and adherents hold these rulers in high regard, and seek to emulate them.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

TITLE_laskandar_restoration;Sikandar's Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC_laskandar_restoration;Originally a minor ruler in Maharashtra, Sikandar of Bandra found inspiration in the tales of a certain pre-event emperor called Shivaji, whose empire is said to have stretched from sea to sea. At a relatively young age, he managed to subjugate the lands of western Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. As time wore on, parts of his realm gradually broke away until only Rajasthan remained, and that too was gone upon his death. It seemed unlikely that anyone would become worthy of the title "Chhatrapati" again. Nevertheless, you have remade Sikandar's shattered realm, and it is said that rulers across the subcontinent regard you  with fear and awe. It is clear now that Sikandar lives on in the blood of his descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

TITLE_mumbai_triumphant;Mumbai, Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC_mumbai_triumphant;Ever since the coast of Maharashtra was conquered by Yunaneshwar Desai, Mumbai has remained in a desperate situation. The nobles that still remained after the war with the king fled to the city, and elected a new ruler to be their protector against further incursions. Partly due to its location in the middle of a major trade route, the ruling class soon turned to more mercantile pursuits, and Mumbai grew rich. Of course, the newly crowned Desai king, son of the conquering Yunaneshwar and a victor in a brief civil war, thought that this wealth would be better off in his hands. The protector of Mumbai was out of options, so he negotiated an annual tribute to the King in return for leaving them alone. But now, everything has changed. Mumbai has come to rule its old lands, and it can finally claim to be a worthy successor to the old kingdom of the Samudra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

The exact number of votes doesn't matter: what does is the fact that you were lawfully chosen by the people to govern them.\n\nOnce the crowd has dispersed, you turn to face your vassals gathered before you.
