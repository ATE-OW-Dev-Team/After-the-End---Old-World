He was twice shot by arrows, three times stabbed by a sword and once beaten with sticks and clubs almost to death by a mob on his travels, but by the time of his death all of Andalusia, Extremadura and the southern regions of Castille and Catalonia were paying tribute to El Palmar rather than Rome. He is the most important post-Event Saint of the Palmarian Church.

	name="Eduardo" # Pope Eutychianus II was the oldest Cardinal at the Council that was supposed to choose the successor of Gregory XVIII. He did not want the title, believing other, younger candidates to be more capable, but after long discussions it was agreed that he was the better choice. He chose an humble name for himself, a lesser known Pope from long before the Event, and kept a low profile. This had the unexpected consequence of him giving his permission for the organization of the corsair ports, with both Andalusia and Castille recruiting some pirates to work under their control, something previous Popes had opposed. The corsair tradition endured in the 26th century and many call Spanish Corsairs the "Pirates of Eutychianus" to this day. His rule saw the first expansions of Catalonia and Andalusia at the expenses of the Castillan crown.

He is believed to have paid the Corsairs installed by the kings to harass the Roman Catholic fleet the Pope had sent to help the Irish rebellion, but this claim is considered an insult by more zealous Palmarians. His plans to conquer Andorra never came to fruition, as the Catalan king still remembered well what had happened last time. He died with only minor successes under his belt, like organizing the expulsion the last Catholic lords from Spain (an Aragonese and a Galician) and changing them for Palmarian rulers.

This ship was said to have sailed over the Atlantic from the Continent in the West. More importantly, the last surviving crewmember spoke of a Pope in Santo Louis, a mysterious Holy See on the western continent of Ameriga, although more information were difficult to obtain due to his foreign idiom, and the man died soon after of fatigue. While most people rejected this, some heard this tale and believed it to be the answer to the question on the current state of the world: the Holy See had truthfully been moved further west from El Palmar. The birth of the Transatlantist heresy begun an age of bloodshed in Spain.

While he died before his Roman counterpart, he dealt with the bulk of the talks, and his words were followed by his successors.
