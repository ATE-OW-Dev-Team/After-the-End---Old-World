His three decades of pontificate are considered the main origin of the Palmarian predominancy in Spain. He traveled far and wide throughout Spain. Surviving texts from the period testify of a man with an intelligent mind, an active body, and no fear of suffering for his religion. He was twice shot by arrows, three times stabbed by a sword and once beaten with sticks and clubs almost to death by a mob on his travels, but by the time of his death all of Andalusia, Extremadura and the southern regions of Castille and Catalonia were paying tribute to El Palmar rather than Rome. He is the most important post-Event Saint of the Palmarian Church.

This severed any hope from the Spanish population that the two faith could cooperate, and made the Palmarian missionary effort to convert Spain far stronger. Peter IV's crowning success was the conversion of the merchant city of Maiorca, a slap in the face of Gregory XVII, who had called it a shining example of true Catholicism just two years prior.
